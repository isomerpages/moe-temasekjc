# PARENTS SUPPORT GROUP (PEERS)

## PARENT-COLLEGE PARTNERSHIP

<p style="text-align: justify;">At TJC, we strongly believe that education is a shared responsibility between the College and families. As such, we endeavour to forge strong partnerships with parents so that the academic and character development of our students can be effectively achieved.</p>
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond College initiated events and efforts, the Parent Support Group (PSG) actively initiates new opportunities to strengthen our partnership. To capture this spirit more accurately, the PSG was renamed as TJC PEERS (Parents Enthusiastically Engaged in Rendering Support) in 2010.</p>
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">PEERS actively participates in College events and organises activities to engage parents. Activities include parent-child bonding sessions and parenting workshops. PEERS also plays a significant role in providing snacks for our graduating students while they study in college and inspiring them with motivation packs and words of encouragement before their GCE A-Level examination.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">The PEERS Committee invites all parents of TJCians to join them in their activities! For any enquiries about PEERS, please email them to: <a href="mailto:PEERS.temasekjc@gmail.com">PEERS.temasekjc@gmail.com</a></p>
