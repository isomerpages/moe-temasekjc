# VALUES & MISSION

![](/images/About/Compass%20Points.jpg)

<center>“Our Vision guides us, our Mission steers us, and our Values anchor us”</center>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The TJC ethos is expressed in five facets of the compass: Our College Vision, Mission, Values, Motto and Desired Outcomes. At the core of the compass lie our College Values, which represent who we are and serve as guiding principles. Our aspiration, as embodied in the Vision, is positioned at the North point, and our Mission is positioned at the South point, representing actions that will realise the Vision. Our Motto at the East point symbolises the beginning of our journey as a College: “For College, For Nation,” which leads us to Our Desired Outcomes for students at the West point.</p>
