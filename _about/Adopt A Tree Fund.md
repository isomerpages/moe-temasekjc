# ADOPT-A-TREE FUND

**Fund Raising to Support our Scholarships and Awards**

  

The Adopt-a-Tree Fund has been instrumental in supporting the scholarship schemes offered by the College to deserving students who excel in academic and non-academic pursuits. The scholarship schemes provide opportunities for students regardless of their family background, so that they can do their utmost and achieve many peaks of excellence. To date, more than 230 recipients have benefitted from the scholarships.
