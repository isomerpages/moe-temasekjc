# ALUMNI

<p style="text-align: justify;">As the College strives to groom and nurture the thinkers, leaders and trailblazers of tomorrow, we take pride in the fact that the many who have walked through our gates are now leading and making their mark in society through their contributions in diverse fields.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">The TJC Alumni fosters closer relations between the College and our graduands, as well as promotes social, cultural and recreational activities among our members. We encourage all former students of the College to join the TJC Alumni to help them stay connected and updated on College events and fellowship opportunities with other former TJCians.</p>
