<p>We are sooooo excited to share with the TJ Family the latest update on
our Bedok Rebuilt Campus (BRC)! Here’s a bird’s eye view of our new campus,
featuring a majestic structure standing tall and proud in our Bedok South
homeground.</p>
<p>Built to be future-ready, the BRC features one 9-storey teaching block
for IP students and one 12-storey teaching block for JC students on the
4.5-hectare plot. The main buildings fronting the track and field overlook
the spectator stand, mirroring the design of our beloved original campus.
The overall design is anchored on three core elements: People (a connected
community), Architecture (distinctive brickwork) and Heritage (iconic ‘mushroom-shaped’
structure).</p>
<p>The TJ Family is absolutely delighted about our new campus – let’s reimagine
our future back where the TJ legacy first began.</p>
<p><strong><em>New Horizons, Same TJ Spirit!</em></strong>

<p>While we marvel at the modern and handsome profile of the Bedok Rebuilt
Campus (BRC), many alumni will immediately recognize the clever incorporation
of some iconic TJ features such as the façade of the original Admin Building
as well as the Red Brick Wall. Indeed, our BRC has been deftly designed
to reflect our aspirations for the future yet blending seamlessly with
our timeless connection with a place that many have called home.</p>
<p>The BRC facilities will support experiential and collaborative learning
through configurable spaces that cater to varying class sizes and pedagogies
(such as seminar-style teaching and project work discussions), as well
as students’ interests and niche activities.&nbsp; The Campus will include
various spaces for student wellbeing, sports, health and fitness, music
and CCAs (such as an Indoor Sports Hall, sheltered courts and dance studio).&nbsp;
Moreover, multi-functional staff workspaces will further promote formal
and informal staff interactions, while two gardens adjoining the staffroom
offer panoramic views of the campus grounds, creating spaces that enhance
staff well-being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We certainly look forward to moving back to our (new) home, a place where
staff and students learn together, grow together and care for one another.
Let’s continue to write the next chapter of TJ’s history as a TJ Family!!</p>
<p><strong><em>New Spaces, Endless Possibilities!</em></strong>

<p>Here’s another look at the main block of our Bedok Rebuilt Campus (BRC)
fronting Bedok South Road…with our favourite hawker centre just across
the road.</p>
<p>The BRC houses lots of spaces that are conducive for learning, leisure
and various activities. The Campus is designed with environmentally sustainable
features such as energy-efficient and energy-saving fans and LED lights
and smart meters, as well as sensors to monitor energy usage.&nbsp; Lush
greenery such as learning gardens and an innovative rain garden will further
enhance the landscape and biodiversity of the development.</p>
<p>Another special feature is a TJ Heritage Trail, which will serve to preserve
some of our traditional and iconic artefacts, including our sculptural
pieces and heritage items. Indeed, all these new spaces are set to enable
endless possibilities!!</p>
