# JUNIOR COLLEGE REJUVENATION PROGRAMME

**Our Current Campus**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The current TJC campus is set in a sprawling compound which has been described as the Botanic Gardens of the East. As one of the oldest colleges in Singapore, the architectural style of our buildings is unique and creates a special connection between our students and alumni with the college’s illustrious past and rich traditions. We have up-to-date teaching and learning facilities such as the Wee Heng Tin Seminar Room, allowing students the opportunity to learn in a conducive seminar-style setting. Our open spaces such as the wooden swings in our garden, Cafe@TJC and the signature ’mushroom’ areas under LT1 and LT2 are areas for vibrant student life at TJC.</p>

  

**Our College of the Future**

<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of MOE’s initiative to provide high quality infrastructure for JCs and meet future needs, plans are underway for TJC to be rebuilt. The rebuilt school campus will facilitate collaborative and interactive learning and support the educational needs of our students in the future. The new building will be technology-enabled and it will provide greater flexibility of space, movement and class configurations and more seminar-like approaches where student participation and interaction will be enhanced. In addition, an Indoor Sports Hall will make sports and games more accessible throughout the day.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">TJC will move temporarily to the former Tampines Junior College site at Tampines Ave 9 in January 2024, where it will remain until December 2027 while the school campus in Bedok is being rebuilt. Staff and students can look forward to moving back to the college's rebuilt campus in January 2028. The school will ensure that the transition between campuses will be as seamless as possible as we continue providing a top-quality learning experience for all our students.</p>
