# HISTORY & ACHIEVEMENTS
<p style="text-align: justify;">'Established in 1977, the College took on the name ‘Temasek’, meaning ‘Sea Town’, the old name for Singapore. Our College was aptly named after the nation in the hope of preserving the spirit of old Singapore in a rapidly modernising age. In addition, the name was chosen to honour our nation’s forefathers whose resilience and fortitude had seen Singapore through its early days.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Led by our founding Principal Mr Wee Heng Tin, the pioneer batch of teachers crafted TJC’s motto –<i>For College, For Nation</i> – to be the clarion call for all TJCians to contribute to our college, our community and our nation. As the College continues to groom and nurture the thinkers, leaders and trailblazers of tomorrow, we take pride in celebrating its rich and illustrious past, as well as reinventing ourselves to continue providing quality learning experiences for our students through <i>Temasek Excellence</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Under the dynamic leadership of our past and present principals, together with a capable and enthusiastic staff fraternity who pursue professional excellence, the College has grown from strength to strength. Today, TJC is a Centre of Excellence for Research and an established Centre for the MOE Humanities Scholarship Programme, the Music Elective Programme and the Chinese Language Elective Programme.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">Our College crest, designed by Mr Seah Lye Huat, a pioneering staff of the PE Department, depicts the letters TJC in bold form, set against a green background which represents a clean and green environment. The letter T in yellow reflects the iconic architecture of our College lecture theatres. The divisions in the cross-bar of the T stand for the five national ideals of justice, equality, happiness, prosperity and progress. The segments in the trunk of that letter symbolise the four major races working in unison towards these ideals.</p>
