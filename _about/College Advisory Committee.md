# COLLEGE ADVISORY COMMITTEE

<p style="text-align: justify;">The College Advisory Committee (CAC) partners staff at TJC to raise the College’s standing by aligning their advice and ideas towards making Temasek JC an institute of distinction. CAC members are strong supporters of college events and programmes and play an active role in providing resources, expertise, support, opportunities and experiences to enhance teaching and learning.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">Believing that no student should be left behind, the CAC recognises the variety of abilities and talents that students possess, sees the worth in each of them and enhances student well-being by providing financial assistance to needy students who are Singapore Citizens. This benefits TJCians with the best educational opportunities possible.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">The CAC affirms students for outstanding performance both in the academic areas and their CCAs through various TJC awards and scholarships, and presents Long Service Awards to staff members for their commitment to the education service. On Staff Day, the CAC recognises the importance that staff play in developing Temasek Excellence in our students. CAC members are advocates of giving and contributing to promote the interest and welfare of the College.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">To deepen students’ learning and development, the CAC members have been generously offering their time and expertise to widen the resource base of the College, enabling the College to forge strategic partnerships to enrich its programmes such as the Temasek Internship Programme (TIP). They also provide mentorship for our students in the Talent Development Programme (TDP).</p>
