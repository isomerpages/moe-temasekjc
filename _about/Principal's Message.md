# PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE

Warmest greetings: we are very happy to share the TJ story with you!

<p style="text-align: justify;">“Success is a journey, not a destination. The doing is often more important than the outcome.” (quote attributed to Arthur Ashe). Do walk our ‘journeys’ with us through our social media pages: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/temasekjc/?hl=en" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Temasek.Junior.College/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To read about our ‘destinations’, view our <a href="/about/history-n-achievements" target="_blank">Achievements</a> and our <a href="/temasek-experience/college-yearbooks" target="_blank">2020 Yearbook</a>.</p>

  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Both our journey and our destination speak for themselves, and we would like to warmly thank our invaluable partners: parents, College Advisory Committee, Alumni, Parents and the many partners in the Bedok Community, in Singapore and across the world.</p>

  

<p style="text-align: justify;">From 2024, our current Campus at Bedok will be rebuilt and we will be sited at the former Tampines JC campus. While we are there, it will not just be business as usual, but a period of opportunities, catalysts for growth and incubators for innovation, and for coming together as the close-knit TJ family.</p>

  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally: a word about myself. I joined Education Service in 1997 and have held various appointments, including Vice-Principal at TJ (2005-2007). I was also Principal of two secondary schools and Director, Pre-school Education Branch, MOE, where I set up the MOE Kindergartens. These were invaluable experiences which have honed my mantra <i><b>Dare to Try</b></i>: simply put, <i><b>Dare to Try</b></i> means that if you think something is worthwhile doing, and there is no known reason to not do it, then you should give it a try. If there are unforeseen outcomes, then we smile, learn from it and try again (and do not blame anyone!).</p>

  

Join us to be part of the TJ story, and learn what it means to _**Dare to Try**_!
