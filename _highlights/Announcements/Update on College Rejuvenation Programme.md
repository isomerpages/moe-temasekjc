# UPDATE ON COLLEGE REJUVENATION PROGRAMME

<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the COVID-19 situation which has posed severe manpower constraints in the construction sector, disrupted the supply of construction materials, and impacted the progress of a number of school infrastructure projects, there will be a two-year delay to TJC’s College Rejuvenation Programme.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The newly re-built campus at our current site in Bedok will now be ready from January 2028. We will shift to the former TPJC holding site in January 2024 and be there for four years until December 2027.</p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Rest assured that the unique TJ Experience will continue to thrive and that the delay will not affect the overall schooling experience of our students. As TJCians, we will always blaze Temasek’s fame wherever we are, and in whatever we do!</p>
