The TJC Music Elective Program (MEP) is simply brimming with talent, as our young prodigies bring with them so much passion and their individual musical gifts. In addition to honing their craft through the MEP, these MOE Music Elective Scholars participate in a plethora of activities which include concerts and performances, masterclasses as well as interactions with like-minded peers. All our MEP maestros from the Class of 2021 scored Distinctions in H2 Music!  

  

Amongst them isÂ **Wong Jun Yan**, who is an accomplished musician who often dazzled with his performances on a variety of instruments. As Student Conductor of the TJ Symphonic Band, he capably led his bandmates to a Certificate of Distinction at the 2021 Singapore Youth Festival.

**Jeremy Chan**, Section Leader and Quartermaster of TJ String Ensemble, was also instrumental in leading the group to achieve a Certificate of Distinction at the 2021 Singapore Youth Festival. He was also the Aesthetics Advocate of his Class Committee. Both Jeremy and Jun Yan went on to score Distinctions in H3 Music!
