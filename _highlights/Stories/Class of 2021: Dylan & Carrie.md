Outstanding students in TJC are placed in the Talent Development Program (TDP), the College’s pinnacle leadership program to prepare high ability students for top-tier scholarships and university courses. Here, students have the opportunity to build their portfolio, in addition to sharpening their skills in interviews and designing personal statements. More importantly, they get to participate in various dialogues with public service officers and other dignitaries, as well as network with our established alumni through the Temasek Talent Network.

**Dylan Hon** and **Carrie Tan** from the Class of 2021 took part in many TDP activities and these enabled them to sharpen their perspectives and develop insights into their own strengths and aspirations. Dylan, who scored 4 Distinctions, was Vice-Chairperson of his Mazarin team, an Aesthetics Advocate and a Temasek Leadership Showdown Facilitator, in addition to achieving a Certificate of Distinction with the String Ensemble at the SYF. Carrie, who scored 7 Distinctions, was Chairperson of her Class Committee and a Project Director with the Students’ Council. She was also Team Leader of her Citi-YMCA Youth for Causes project and she participated in a variety of essay-writing and science competitions.  

We are proud of Dylan and Carrie, and all our TDP leaders, who scored a median UAS 87.5, with more than 7 in 10 scoring UAS 85 or better!
