# CLASS OF 2020: ARIA RASHID

![](/images/Archive/Stories/Aria%20Rashid.jpg)

<p style="text-align: justify;">While most of her peers were relaxing during the holidays, <b>Aria Rashid</b> spent some of her vacation immersed in the working world as she participated not in one but two internship stints!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At TJC, we want to provide opportunities for our students to explore their career aspirations. The College has set up a University, Scholarship and Placement Office to offer professional advice and guidance, and we organize many activities such as Careers, Scholarships and Higher Education Week and a range of career talks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One of our signature platforms is the Temasek Internship Program which immerses our JC1 students in their chosen areas of interest, where they are mentored and nurtured by leading practitioners in their respective fields, many of whom are TJC alumni. Aria was selected to intern at Alpha Dental Clinic where she experienced first-hand the daily ongoings at the clinic. In addition, under the Young Transport Engineer Program, Aria also had the opportunity to intern at SMRT. All these gave her valuable insights into the particular industry.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">A committed Student Councillor, Aria had an enriched campus experience. She was involved in organizing and facilitating a range of leadership activities, from Orientation 2020, to JC College Spirit Night, to Temasek Leadership Showdown as well as Student Leadership Overseas Immersion Program. She also found time to train and take part in the Singapore Chemistry Olympiad as well as a Mazarin Make-A-Difference project, and eventually scoring 6 Distinctions at the A-levels. Well done, Aria!</p>
