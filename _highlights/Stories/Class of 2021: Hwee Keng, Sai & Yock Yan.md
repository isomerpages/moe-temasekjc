# CLASS OF 2021: HWEE KENG, SAI & YOCK YAN

Since 2005, we have welcomed many bright, passionate and compassionate young men and women to our Integrated Programme. They are our pride and joy, as we witness their growth and development over the years they spend with us.

  

The IP Class of 2021 continued to do the college and themselves proud – they achieved a median UAS 86.6; with 6 in 10 scoring UAS 85 or better; and 1 in 4 scoring a perfect UAS 90. More importantly, our IP students are all-rounders with a zest for life. Let’s meet **Low Hwee Keng**, **Saripalli Bhagat Sai Reddy** and **Wong Yock Yan**.
