Many of our athletes excel on and off the courts – Prithvi Majal and Chen Liang Jung from the Class of 2021 epitomize this tenacity and spirit of excellence.

**Prithvi Majal**, Captain of the Badminton Boys’ team, would put in extra hours to maintain his fitness and strength. He also stepped up as an Orientation Group Leader and a Defy Camp Facilitator, in addition to participating in the Mathematics Olympiad.

**Liang Jung**, Captain of the Table Tennis Boys’ team, is a focused and determined sportsman who set a good example for his peers. In addition, he was selected for the Temasek Internship Program where he was attached to Art Agenda S.E.A., an art consultancy which provides collecting and curatorial services for Southeast Asian art. Liang Jung, who is also a creative maestro, went on to score an A in H2 Art.

Like many of our athletes from the Class of 2021, both Prithvi and Liang Jung demonstrate unwavering dedication and resilience despite the premature cancellation of the National School Games. Both young men also achieved a perfect score of UAS 90. Well done!
