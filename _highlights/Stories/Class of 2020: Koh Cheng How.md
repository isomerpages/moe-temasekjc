# CLASS OF 2020: KOH CHENG HOW


![](/images/Archive/Stories/Koh%20Cheng%20How.jpg)

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Koh Cheng How</b> is the epitome of the ACE TJCian (an Active learner, a Committed citizen and an Ethical leader) – an exceptional all-rounder who has obtained achievements on many fronts.</p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">As President of the 43rd Students’ Council, he led the student population through challenging times. Just a day before the start of the JC Orientation, Singapore reported its first Covid-19 case. As a result, Cheng How and his Council worked through the night to overhaul the program, while trying to retain the essence of an orientation program to welcome the new members of the TJ family.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to representing the College in meeting many foreign and local dignitaries such as the Ambassador of Austria and the High Commissioner of Singapore to the Republic of South Africa, Cheng How was selected to represent Singapore at the Asian and Oceanian High School Students’ Forum. Despite all his commitments, Cheng How even found time to embark on the Temasek Overseas Outreach Program to Vietnam, as well as a Youth-for-Causes Project, and went on to attain a perfect University Admission Score.</p>
