Over the years, the number of TJCians offering A-level subjects at Higher 3 (H3) is increasing, as our outstanding students demonstrate a passion to further develop themselves to achieve peaks of excellence within the context of a broad-based education. In their respective H3 modules, these students engage in different forms of learning and research work.  
  
The Class of 2021 achieved stellar results in their H3 subjects, with more than 1 in 2 scoring Distinctions and 8 in 10 scoring Merits or better. **Jiang Yixuan** aced her H3 Chinese Language and Literature on top of scoring 7 Distinctions; **Reyhern Razali** was rock-solid with his H3 Geography performance while scoring 7 Distinctions; **Chen Yizhou** scored 8 Distinctions including H3 Chemistry; and **Oliver Kong** showed his mathematical prowess by scoring an A for H3 Mathematics and 6 Distinctions overall.  
  
Well done, TJCians!
