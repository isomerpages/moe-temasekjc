<p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2005, the College has enjoyed welcoming Integrated Programme students to the Temasek family. When they join us directly from primary schools, they are barely 13-years old … but it is so heartening to see each and everyone of them grow up over the years, and to see TJC becoming a second home for many of them.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our IP students have definitely forged strong ties, and the six years they spend here have offered them myriad opportunities. **Bethany Chong** of the Class of 2020 committed herself to Modern Dance for 6 years, showing much passion and love for the art form and her peers. She also participated in the Community Laboratory Programme and embarked on the Temasek Overseas Outreach Program to Vietnam. Bethany will be taking up the Public Service Commission scholarship to study material science and engineering at NTU.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Her IP schoolmate, **Tan Wan Gee**, had the chance of a lifetime when she emerged runners-up at the Queen’s Commonwealth Essay competition and received the prize at Buckingham Palace in London. She also took part in the World Tsunami Awareness Day in Japan, further broadening her horizons and global sensitivities. A polymath, Wan Gee is considering biological studies or the liberal arts.</p>
