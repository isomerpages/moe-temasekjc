# CLASS OF 2020: MOHAN HARESH VATWANI

![](/images/Archive/Stories/Mohan%20Haresh%20Vatwani.jpg)

<p style="text-align: justify;">The 2020 A-level results saw the highest number of students scoring UAS of 85 or better, which indicates that a great number of TJCians are eligible for the most competitive courses at top universities. On top of this, our TJCians have involved themselves in many noteworthy causes and activities. One such young advocate is <b>Mohan Haresh Vatwani</b>.</p>

  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mohan was part of a Youth-for-Causes team, whose project was selected amongst many others by YMCA to be implemented. This team – A Meaningful Dream – sought to make a difference in the life of underprivileged children under the care of their chosen Social Service Organization (SSO), Make-a-Wish Singapore. The team organized a public awareness campaign and designed meaningful merchandise to promote Make-a-Wish Singapore's cause to grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions. In the process, the team also raised more than $3,000 for the SSO.</p>

  

<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, Mohan embarked on the Temasek Overseas Outreach Programme to Ben Tre, Vietnam and together with the team, interacted with the local children and assisted in improving the amenities of the community. Mohan also honed his leadership skills through his appointment as Treasurer of the Football team, Orientation Group Leader as well as Assistant Class Chairperson. Indeed, we applaud Mohan and many of such trailblazers with a heart!</p>
