<p style="text-align: justify;">TJCians have always gone the extra mile to show their care for the community, especially through the Mazarin Community Leadership Program. <b>Elias Aljoofri</b> and <b>Erin Joy Thevathasan</b> from the Class of 2021 are two Mazariners who have initiated such meaningful projects.</p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Elias was the Leader of Team Ala Carte, which focused on raising awareness of the issue of plastic waste. Besides touching base with National Environment Agency and Zero Waste SG, the team promoted Zero Waste Sunday, conducted a sharing session with Bedok Green Secondary School’s Environmental Club and initiated a BYOttle campaign in TJC.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Erin’s Mazarin Team Elpis showed much resilience as they had to look for another social service agency midway through their project, but Erin and her teammates were resolute in focusing on their aim of inspiring disadvantaged primary school children to achieve their dreams. Eventually they collaborated with Care Community Services Society Singapore and raised almost $3,000.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed, Erin and Elias embody TJ’s culture of care as they have contributed much of their time and effort in making a difference to those around them. In all, our Mazariners have done the college proud with their meaningful projects, and scoring a median UAS 88.75 at the A-levels! Erin and Elias both achieved perfect scores and Elias has been awarded the Public Service Commission scholarship on top of this.</p>
