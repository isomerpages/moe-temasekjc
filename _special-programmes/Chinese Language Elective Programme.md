# CHINESE LANGUAGE ELECTIVE PROGRAMME




<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the start of the Integrated Programme, we have been offering school-based CLEP to selected IP Year 3 and IP Year 4 students. To encourage students to learn Chinese Language more deeply at a younger age, the Chinese Language Elective Programme at Secondary Level (CLEP-Sec) is introduced by the Ministry of Education to be implemented from 2020. Temasek Junior College (IP) is proud to be once again selected as one of the nine schools to offer this programme. We are also the only non-SAP school that is offering CLEP at both IP and JC levels.</p>
