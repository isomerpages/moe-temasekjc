    <td><p style="text-align: justify;">The Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) was first introduced in 1990 at Junior College level, and Temasek Junior College was one of the first two colleges selected to offer this two-year programme to nurture the linguistic talent of students. The long history and rich experience of the College in offering the CLEP place us in good stead to help students attain a higher level of proficiency and develop a better understanding of Chinese Language and Literature. Since its inauguration, we have groomed countless outstanding bilingual talents who had since come through our gates.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the start of the Integrated Programme, we have been offering school-based CLEP to selected IP Year 3 and IP Year 4 students. To encourage students to learn Chinese Language more deeply at a younger age, the Chinese Language Elective Programme at Secondary Level (CLEP-Sec) is introduced by the Ministry of Education to be implemented from 2020. Temasek Junior College (IP) is proud to be once again selected as one of the nine schools to offer this programme. We are also the only non-SAP school that is offering CLEP at both IP and JC levels.</p>
