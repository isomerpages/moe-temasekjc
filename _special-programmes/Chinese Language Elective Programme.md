    <td><p style="text-align: justify;">The Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) was first introduced in 1990 at Junior College level, and Temasek Junior College was one of the first two colleges selected to offer this two-year programme to nurture the linguistic talent of students. The long history and rich experience of the College in offering the CLEP place us in good stead to help students attain a higher level of proficiency and develop a better understanding of Chinese Language and Literature. Since its inauguration, we have groomed countless outstanding bilingual talents who had since come through our gates.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the start of the Integrated Programme, we have been offering school-based CLEP to selected IP Year 3 and IP Year 4 students. To encourage students to learn Chinese Language more deeply at a younger age, the Chinese Language Elective Programme at Secondary Level (CLEP-Sec) is introduced by the Ministry of Education to be implemented from 2020. Temasek Junior College (IP) is proud to be once again selected as one of the nine schools to offer this programme. We are also the only non-SAP school that is offering CLEP at both IP and JC levels.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">CLEP aims to nurture promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Chinese, and enhance their understanding of Chinese literature. The programme also aims to develop students to become effectively bilingual.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">CLEP-Sec and CLEP-JC are two separate 2-year programmes and the progression from CLEP-Sec to CLEP-JC is not mandatory. IP students would have to reapply for the programme after Year 4. Nevertheless, all CLEP-Sec students are encouraged to continue in the programme at the junior college (JC) level.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">CLEP students who are Singapore citizens and achieved outstanding performance will be considered for the CLES awarded by MOE. A certificate of recognition will be presented to students upon completion of CLEP-Sec and CLEP-JC respectively.</p>
