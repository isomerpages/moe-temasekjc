    <td><p style="text-align: justify;">The Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) was first introduced in 1990 at Junior College level, and Temasek Junior College was one of the first two colleges selected to offer this two-year programme to nurture the linguistic talent of students. The long history and rich experience of the College in offering the CLEP place us in good stead to help students attain a higher level of proficiency and develop a better understanding of Chinese Language and Literature. Since its inauguration, we have groomed countless outstanding bilingual talents who had since come through our gates.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the start of the Integrated Programme, we have been offering school-based CLEP to selected IP Year 3 and IP Year 4 students. To encourage students to learn Chinese Language more deeply at a younger age, the Chinese Language Elective Programme at Secondary Level (CLEP-Sec) is introduced by the Ministry of Education to be implemented from 2020. Temasek Junior College (IP) is proud to be once again selected as one of the nine schools to offer this programme. We are also the only non-SAP school that is offering CLEP at both IP and JC levels.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">CLEP aims to nurture promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Chinese, and enhance their understanding of Chinese literature. The programme also aims to develop students to become effectively bilingual.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">CLEP-Sec and CLEP-JC are two separate 2-year programmes and the progression from CLEP-Sec to CLEP-JC is not mandatory. IP students would have to reapply for the programme after Year 4. Nevertheless, all CLEP-Sec students are encouraged to continue in the programme at the junior college (JC) level.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">CLEP students who are Singapore citizens and achieved outstanding performance will be considered for the CLES awarded by MOE. A certificate of recognition will be presented to students upon completion of CLEP-Sec and CLEP-JC respectively.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">CLEP-Sec is offered from IP Year 3. All IP students enrolled in CLEP-Sec must offer school-based Literature in Chinese. Students from the CLEP-Sec centres will also jointly attend two signature activities organised by MOE. A one to two-day camp will be held locally during the June holidays of IP Year 3 with a focus on PSEI MTL Pathways and MTL-related interests. A one to two-week overseas immersion programme will be organised towards the end of IP3.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond the programme organised by MOE, we also arrange a series of school-based activities for our students to enhance their learning experience. This includes overseas immersion trips, literary lectures, lyrics writing cum song composition workshops, Meet-the-Author sessions, journalism workshop, creative writing workshops and translation workshops etc.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">CLEP at the junior college level spans a total of two years, and students who are enrolled will have to offer Chinese Language and Literature at the H2 level. The main focus areas of the curriculum include literary theory and creative writing, study of selected works of both classical and modern Chinese literature, and acquisition of knowledge of Chinese culture.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Students participating in the CLEP will have the opportunity to participate in a variety of activities that not only train their writing skills but also deepen their understanding of Chinese culture. One key enrichment programme is the CLEP Camp, a three-day residential camp held in early June for JC Year 1 students. During the camp, invited well-known overseas writers will share their writing experience and guide students on how to write creatively.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">The programme also provides an opportunity for our CLEP students to enhance their appreciation of literary works and understanding of the Chinese culture. During their stay in Beijing and Taipei, the CLEP students will also visit schools, attend literary talks, and embark on educational tours, which aim to deepen their understanding and awareness of both traditional and contemporary Chinese culture through authentic experiences.</p>
