# TEMASEK HUMANITIES PROGRAMME

<p style="text-align: justify;">One of only eight A-Level MOE Humanities Scholarship Centres, the Temasek Humanities Programme (THP) aims to create leaders in the Humanities through embracing the spirit of inquiry. Our three signature programmes reflect this focus on inquiry, and our students come through our programme with a critical appreciation of pertinent issues in our world today as well as the skills to kick start change. Read on to find out more about our signature programmes.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The TDSS is an annual conference that the THP students organise. Each conference revolves around a theme that the THP students lead their peers in exploring, before culminating in a conference with a distinguished speaker in the field of interest.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Our students’ THP journey culminates in the Capstone Project, which empowers our J2 students to conduct independent research on an area of their interest to produce an academic paper. They present their findings at the HumaniTEA@TJC, where they defend their research process and findings to their peers.</p>

    <label for="accordion4">MENTORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES</label>
    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Signature programmes aside, the THP empowers our students to take on life after Junior College. We pair each THP student with a teacher-mentor who supports them in their tertiary aspirations, ensuring that they are well prepared for university and scholarship applications. Our rigourous programme has yielded very strong outcomes; THP students have consistently attained median UAS scores of at least 87.5 at the GCE ‘A’ Levels, and go on to take up highly renowned university and scholarship placements.</p>
