# TEMASEK HUMANITIES PROGRAMME

<p style="text-align: justify;">One of only eight A-Level MOE Humanities Scholarship Centres, the Temasek Humanities Programme (THP) aims to create leaders in the Humanities through embracing the spirit of inquiry. Our three signature programmes reflect this focus on inquiry, and our students come through our programme with a critical appreciation of pertinent issues in our world today as well as the skills to kick start change. Read on to find out more about our signature programmes.</p>
