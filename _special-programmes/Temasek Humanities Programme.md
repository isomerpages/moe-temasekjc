<h1>TEMASEK HUMANITIES PROGRAMME</h1>
<p>In the Temasek Humanities Programme (THP), we take pride in supporting
our students as they become leaders in the Humanities. The THP embraces
the spirit of inquiry in shaping thoughtful, independent and action-oriented
navigators of an increasingly complex and fast-paced world.</p>
<p>A hallmark of the Humanities disciplines, our inquiry-based approach differentiates
itself through a heightened emphasis on autonomy and intellectual curiosity.
Our focus on inquiry is reflected in our sustained exploration of a learning
theme for the year, which is fleshed out through two signature programmes
– the HumaniTEA@TJC and the HumaniTJourney. Read on to find out more about
these signature programmes.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The HumaniTEA@TJC</p>
<p>The HumaniTEA@TJC is an annual conference that the THP students organise.
Each conference revolves around a theme that the THP students lead their
peers in exploring, which leads to a conference with a panel of distinguished
speakers in the field of interest. The theme for 2024 was “Stereotropical”,
an exploration of the power, politics, and perspectives that underpin the
notion of a tropical paradise. This year, our cohort theme is "Nature Fights
Back", an exploration of the relationships - reliance and resistance -
between us and our natural living environment.</p>

<p>HUMANITJOURNEY</p>
<p>The HumaniTJourney gives THP students the space to push the boundaries
of their exploration. THP students choose a country they would like to
explore, based on key inquiry questions they want to answer. In past years,
we have travelled to a diverse range of countries, such as Vietnam, Thailand
and China. As they craft learning experiences, collect data, and produce
well-reasoned analyses, our THP students are trained to think incisively
and independently about various issues in society. The HumaniTJourney is
an opportunity for our students to navigate foreign (and local) societies
confidently and critically.</p>

<p>CAPSTONE PROJECTS</p>
<p>The Capstone Project empowers our J2 students to deepen their appreciation
of the inquiry process. THP students identify a question to explore and
conduct independent research to produce an academic paper. As mentioned
above, they then present their findings at HumaniTEA, where they have to
defend their research process and findings to their peers. With papers
exploring the morality of lying to the sociological studies of memes, the
Capstone Project gives our students free rein to wonder at life’s questions
and equips our students with the necessary mindset and skills to thrive
in today’s complex and uncertain world.</p>

<p>Signature programmes aside, the THP empowers our students to take on life
after Junior College. We pair each THP student with a teacher-mentor who
supports them in their tertiary aspirations, ensuring that they are well
prepared for university and scholarship applications.</p>
