# TEMASEK HUMANITIES PROGRAMME

<p style="text-align: justify;">One of only eight A-Level MOE Humanities Scholarship Centres, the Temasek Humanities Programme (THP) aims to create leaders in the Humanities through embracing the spirit of inquiry. Our three signature programmes reflect this focus on inquiry, and our students come through our programme with a critical appreciation of pertinent issues in our world today as well as the skills to kick start change. Read on to find out more about our signature programmes.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">Our students’ THP journey culminates in the Capstone Project, which empowers our J2 students to conduct independent research on an area of their interest to produce an academic paper. They present their findings at the HumaniTEA@TJC, where they defend their research process and findings to their peers.</p>
