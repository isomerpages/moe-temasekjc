# TEMASEK HUMANITIES PROGRAMME

<p style="text-align: justify;">One of only seven A-Level MOE Humanities Scholarship Centres, the Temasek Humanities Programme (THP) aims to create leaders in the Humanities through embracing the spirit of inquiry. Our three signature programmes - the Temasek Distinguished Speakers Series (TDSS), the HumaniTJourney, and the Capstone Project - reflect this focus on inquiry, and our students come through our programme with a critical appreciation of pertinent issues in our world today as well as the skills to kick start change. Read on to find out more about our signature programmes.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The HumaniTEA@TJC is an annual conference the THP students organise. Each conference revolves around a theme that the THP students lead their peers in exploring, which leads to a conference with a distinguished speaker in the field of interest.</p>

</p><p> After engaging with the keynote speaker in the main conference, participants also get the chance to hear from JC2 THP students as they share about their Capstone Projects (see below for more info!). Through this conference, our students emerge as confident leaders, ready to engage others in dialogue.

			<p style="text-align: justify;">The HumaniTJourney is an opportunity for our students to explore foreign (and local) societies in a confident and critical manner. Through the HumaniTJourney, students are given the space to construct learning experiences, collect data, and produce well-reasoned analyses in response to various issues. </p>

</p><p>Signature programmes aside, the THP empowers our students to take on life after Junior College. We pair each THP student with a teacher-mentor who supports them in their tertiary aspirations, ensuring that they are well prepared for university and scholarship applications. Our rigourous programme has yielded very strong outcomes; THP students attain a median UAS score of 87.5 out of 90 at the GCE 'A' Levels, and go on to take up highly renowned university and scholarship placements.
