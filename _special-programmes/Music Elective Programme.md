# MUSIC ELECTIVE PROGRAMME

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Music Elective Programme (MEP)Â at TJC seeks to cultivate each student in their musical inclinations and nurture them to be critical and creative thinkers, composers and performers of music. Through the study of music in its cultural, historical and social contexts, our students will explore a variegated repertoire from both the Western music and World music traditions. This will develop their musical sensitivity and multi-cultural awareness, and hone their abilities to appreciate, analyse and critique a diverse spectrum of works.</p>
