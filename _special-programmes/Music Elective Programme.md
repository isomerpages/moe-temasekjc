# MUSIC ELECTIVE PROGRAMME

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Music Elective Programme (MEP) at TJC seeks to cultivate each student in their musical inclinations and nurture them to be critical and creative thinkers, composers and performers of music. Through the study of music in its cultural, historical and social contexts, our students will explore a variegated repertoire from both the Western music and World music traditions. This will develop their musical sensitivity and multi-cultural awareness, and hone their abilities to appreciate, analyse and critique a diverse spectrum of works.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Innovative in its interdisciplinary approach, the TJC Music Elective Programme (MEP) for IP students guides them to explore music in relation to art, literature, politics, religion and theatre. In this subject, students will be exposed to music repertoire of both the Western traditions and non-Western traditions. Such an emphasis on multi-culturalism allows for the appreciation, analysis and critique of a diverse spectrum of works, and equips each student to become a musician skilled in analysis, composition, performing, and research.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CURRICULUM</b><br>Our MEP is a 4-year programme offered to the 6-Year IP students from Year 1. In this subject, students are exposed to a diverse range of musical genres and cultures, and will be engaged in musical activities that integrate the three core skills of holistic musicianship: performing, composing and listening. Students will have an in-depth engagement with music by learning music in relation to its historical and cultural context, perform and compose in these different styles, and draw links across different traditions and the other arts.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The GCE 'A' Level Music syllabus approaches the study of Music through Music Studies and Music Making. In TJC, our students will learn from tutors specialising in the different components of the paper, namely Asian Music, Western Art Music and Jazz, Creating (Free composition and arrangement), and will also have lectures and personal consultations in their Performing component. As they assemble their individual portfolios in free composition and arrangement, our students will acquire essential 21st Century skills in music technology through the use of music notation and sound recording software. Beyond the curriculum, authentic learning experiences are provided to equip our students to be practitioners and advocates of the arts, and to apprise them of areas of study at tertiary music institutions and career opportunities in the music industry.</p>
