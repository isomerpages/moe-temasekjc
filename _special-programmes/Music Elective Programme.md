# MUSIC ELECTIVE PROGRAMME

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Music Elective Programme (MEP) at TJC seeks to cultivate each student in their musical inclinations and nurture them to be critical and creative thinkers, composers and performers of music. Through the study of music in its cultural, historical and social contexts, our students will explore a variegated repertoire from both the Western music and World music traditions. This will develop their musical sensitivity and multi-cultural awareness, and hone their abilities to appreciate, analyse and critique a diverse spectrum of works.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Innovative in its interdisciplinary approach, the TJC Music Elective Programme (MEP) for IP students guides them to explore music in relation to art, literature, politics, religion and theatre. In this subject, students will be exposed to music repertoire of both the Western traditions and non-Western traditions. Such an emphasis on multi-culturalism allows for the appreciation, analysis and critique of a diverse spectrum of works, and equips each student to become a musician skilled in analysis, composition, performing, and research.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CURRICULUM</b><br>Our MEP is a 4-year programme offered to the 6-Year IP students from Year 1. In this subject, students are exposed to a diverse range of musical genres and cultures, and will be engaged in musical activities that integrate the three core skills of holistic musicianship: performing, composing and listening. Students will have an in-depth engagement with music by learning music in relation to its historical and cultural context, perform and compose in these different styles, and draw links across different traditions and the other arts.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</b><br>Students will indicate their interest in joining the TJC MEP during the IP1 Orientation. All interested applicants will undergo a written diagnostic test and an audition-cum-interview. </p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The GCE 'A' Level Music syllabus approaches the study of Music through Music Studies and Music Making. In TJC, our students will learn from tutors specialising in the different components of the paper, namely Asian Music, Western Art Music and Jazz, Creating (Free composition and arrangement), and will also have lectures and personal consultations in their Performing component. As they assemble their individual portfolios in free composition and arrangement, our students will acquire essential 21st Century skills in music technology through the use of music notation and sound recording software. Beyond the curriculum, authentic learning experiences are provided to equip our students to be practitioners and advocates of the arts, and to apprise them of areas of study at tertiary music institutions and career opportunities in the music industry.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>MOTIF XII</b><br>The 12th edition of the annual TJC MEP MOTIF showcase featured current students and alumni coming together for an evening of music making and performance. Held at the Esplanade Recital Studio, the concert featured performances from our JC2 students, while students from the other levels and alumni collaborated to present a diverse range of performances. These included the world premieres of Escape for Wind Quintet, written by MEP alumnus Marcus Ong, as well as that of Kitchen Nightmares, an original theatrical piece conceptualised and conceived by our 2019 batch of JC1 MEP students.

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>VIVACE PIANO ENSEMBLE COMPETITION</b><br>The JC1 MEP cohort took part in the 10th installment of Vivace in 2019, an inter-school piano ensemble competition organised by National Junior College. Of the five piano duos presented, two won the Silver award while one emerged with a Gold with Commendation award, placing among the top 6 duos from across the country. In preparation for the competition, the duos were coached by TJC MEP alumnus Bertram Wee, a graduate of the Royal College of Music. Through this experience, the participants gained a newfound appreciation for contemporary piano duet repertoire, while expanding their range of performing skills, particularly in a collaborative setting.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>TAIWAN CULTURAL IMMERSION TRIP 2019</b><br>One of the key highlights of our Music Elective Programme is the biennial overseas immersion trip for our students to learn about the impact of music in other parts of the world. In Taiwan, our IP3 to JC2 MEP students broadened their musical horizons through attending a series of workshops at the Taipei National University of the Arts. These focused on various aspects of musical study - traditional Taiwanese musical genres (Nanguan and Beiguan), contemporary music performance and creative composition. This was complemented by a visit to National Taiwan College of Performing Arts, where they observed the local students in action during rehearsals for Peking Opera and Hakka Opera. The students gained a fresh cultural perspective and deeper appreciation for the arts beyond the local context.</p>
