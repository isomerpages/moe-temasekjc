# SCIENCE

<center>Have you ever wondered how lithium-ion batteries which have transformed the society worked? We learn that we need oxygen for the conversion of food into useful energy. Have you ever wondered how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability?</center>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Science curriculum is guided by our mission to develop independent scientific inquirers and confident communicators, equipped with innovative problem solving skills. We align our teaching approaches with our vision of nurturing scientific minds with a strong spirit of inquiry, grounded in ethics and humanity. Our teachers employ student-centred pedagogies in their lectures and tutorial lessons, as we believe that students learn best through active involvement in the learning process and collaboration.</p>
