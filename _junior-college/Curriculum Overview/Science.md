# SCIENCE

<center>Have you ever wondered how lithium-ion batteries which have transformed the society worked? We learn that we need oxygen for the conversion of food into useful energy. Have you ever wondered how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability?</center>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Science curriculum is guided by our mission to develop independent scientific inquirers and confident communicators, equipped with innovative problem solving skills. We align our teaching approaches with our vision of nurturing scientific minds with a strong spirit of inquiry, grounded in ethics and humanity. Our teachers employ student-centred pedagogies in their lectures and tutorial lessons, as we believe that students learn best through active involvement in the learning process and collaboration.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Temasek STEM Academy (Talent and Enrichment Programmes)</b><br>Our students have achieved excellence in the various academic areas. We aim to groom outstanding Mathematics and Science students to be leaders with 21st Century Competencies. Students can look forward to various exploratory and experiential STEM-based learning opportunities within and beyond the classroom based on interests and aspirations, supported by a team of teacher mentors and external partnerships. These programmes stretch students who are passionate about sciences, technology, engineering and math, using an interdisciplinary and applied approach.</p>

			<center><i>Why do our fingers look different from our toes even though each one of us developed from one single fertilised egg? What are the uses of a molecule of DNA?

			<p style="text-align: justify;">These are thought-provoking questions raised by our Biology students during the course of their study. Join us, the Fantastic TJC Biology Department, to unravel the mysteries of life around us!</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CURRICULUM</b><br>The rapid and continuous progress in the field of life sciences demands the learner to have sound knowledge of the nature of science, acquire scientific inquiry skills, and being able to relate science to societal needs. To achieve these demands, we provide a nurturing environment for our students to be inquisitive and deepen their understanding of Biology. Our students will discover for themselves how life is sustained and how they can apply their knowledge to ensure sustainable living.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Students will build a strong foundation in the understanding of life at cellular and molecular levels, and make connections between these micro-systems and the organism as a whole. This ability to draw links and make connections enables our students to relate to other systems they encounter in their daily lives, a skill critical for real-world problem solving.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">We strive to deliver the curriculum with our students’ learning interests and readiness in mind. We engage our students through inquiry-based learning and provide many opportunities for collaboration with their peers and for them to communicate their ideas. We also utilise real-life examples for students to explore, keep updated with current affairs, while at the same time applying relevant scientific concepts to understand or solve problems.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">E-pedagogical approaches are employed to groom our students to be future-ready digital learners. We create resources on the Student Learning Space (SLS) and other e-learning platforms so that our students can learn at their own pace, and beyond the confines of a physical space such as a laboratory.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">We aim to train our students to be critical learners through thinking routines to facilitate the development of their metacognition skills.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ENRICHMENT</b><br>Exciting learning journeys to Pulau Semakau and Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum serve as experiential learning opportunities for our students. Students learn beyond the classroom and laboratories, where they hear from professionals in niche areas and higher institutions of learning and research. We also engage local and overseas university professors and our very own TJC Alumni to give talks for our students to raise awareness on their career prospects, and enhance their scientific literacy.</p>

			<center><i>How do geckos stick to walls? Why does water expand as it freezes? How is coloured glass produced?</i></center>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">These are just some of the interesting application of Chemistry concepts. Chemistry is the study of the structure, properties and transformation of matter at the atomic/molecular level. Chemistry is often seen to play a central role in science. It is built on an understanding of the laws of physics that govern the nature of particles such as atoms, protons and electrons, and at the same time provides a basis for studying and understanding the molecules and reactions in biological systems.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CURRICULUM</b><br>At TJC, our Chemistry curriculum has been developed to enhance students’ understanding of chemical concepts and chemical systems. We aim to develop in students the way of thinking to explain phenomena, approach and solve problems in chemical systems through making connections between the concepts within Chemistry and with other Science disciplines. Diverse pedagogical approaches are adopted to cultivate our students’ interest by building knowledge and skills necessary for their higher education aspirations in Chemistry-related fields.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">These pedagogical approaches include leveraging on Productive Failure to learn how to plan an experiment and how to better use visualisation tools. Through an experiential learning approach, students get to deepen their conceptual understanding. Learning studies are also conducted to improve effectiveness of students’ learning.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ENRICHMENT</b><br>Our students are provided with many opportunities for learning beyond the classroom. These learning experiences develop the students in the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the practice of science. The aim is for our students to become scientifically literate and useful citizens who are well-prepared for the challenges of the 21st century.<br>Research opportunities are available for students who wish to enrich their learning and deepen their knowledge of the sciences. These projects can be carried out within college or with an institute of higher learning in science.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think nature's imagination is so much greater than man's, she's never going to let us relax,” said Nobel Prize physicist Richard Feynman. Through our programme, students make a significant step in acquiring knowledge of nature and how the universe behaves. Students would be able to draw links between physics, mathematics and the other sciences, which enable them to relate to advances in scientific research and design solutions while utilising new technologies. They will build a strong foundation for their pursuit of a career in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CURRICULUM</b><br>TJCians are encouraged to think more broadly about the physical world through an exposure to rich learning experiences, both within and beyond the college. We aim to deliver a teaching and learning programme that inculcates problem-solving skills in every student, to be able to evaluate real-world problems and generate plausible solutions. Our teachers regularly engage students in in-depth discussions to develop their cognitive ability and to nurture an appreciation and love for the subject.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ENRICHMENT</b><br>We conduct training programmes and provide strong support for students to participate in the Singapore Physics Olympiad and other physics-related competitions and fairs. Our students also benefit from a variety of enrichment programmes offered by the many partnerships that the Physics department has established over the years. Students take part in competitions, overseas experiential programmes and hands-on workshops and seminars, which deepen their interest and knowledge in the subject, sharpening their learning at an advanced level.</p>
