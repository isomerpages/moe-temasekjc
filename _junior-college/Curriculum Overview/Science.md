# SCIENCE

<center>Have you ever wondered how lithium-ion batteries which have transformed the society worked? We learn that we need oxygen for the conversion of food into useful energy. Have you ever wondered how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability?</center>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Science curriculum is guided by our mission to develop independent scientific inquirers and confident communicators, equipped with innovative problem solving skills. We align our teaching approaches with our vision of nurturing scientific minds with a strong spirit of inquiry, grounded in ethics and humanity. Our teachers employ student-centred pedagogies in their lectures and tutorial lessons, as we believe that students learn best through active involvement in the learning process and collaboration.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Temasek STEM Academy (Talent and Enrichment Programmes)</b><br>Our students have achieved excellence in the various academic areas. We aim to groom outstanding Mathematics and Science students to be leaders with 21st Century Competencies. Students can look forward to various exploratory and experiential STEM-based learning opportunities within and beyond the classroom based on interests and aspirations, supported by a team of teacher mentors and external partnerships. These programmes stretch students who are passionate about sciences, technology, engineering and math, using an interdisciplinary and applied approach.</p>

			<center><i>Why do our fingers look different from our toes even though each one of us developed from one single fertilised egg? What are the uses of a molecule of DNA?

			<p style="text-align: justify;">These are thought-provoking questions raised by our Biology students during the course of their study. Join us, the Fantastic TJC Biology Department, to unravel the mysteries of life around us!</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CURRICULUM</b><br>The rapid and continuous progress in the field of life sciences demands the learner to have sound knowledge of the nature of science, acquire scientific inquiry skills, and being able to relate science to societal needs. To achieve these demands, we provide a nurturing environment for our students to be inquisitive and deepen their understanding of Biology. Our students will discover for themselves how life is sustained and how they can apply their knowledge to ensure sustainable living.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Students will build a strong foundation in the understanding of life at cellular and molecular levels, and make connections between these micro-systems and the organism as a whole. This ability to draw links and make connections enables our students to relate to other systems they encounter in their daily lives, a skill critical for real-world problem solving.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">We strive to deliver the curriculum with our studentsâ€™ learning interests and readiness in mind. We engage our students through inquiry-based learning and provide many opportunities for collaboration with their peers and for them to communicate their ideas. We also utilise real-life examples for students to explore, keep updated with current affairs, while at the same time applying relevant scientific concepts to understand or solve problems.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">E-pedagogical approaches are employed to groom our students to be future-ready digital learners. We create resources on the Student Learning Space (SLS) and other e-learning platforms so that our students can learn at their own pace, and beyond the confines of a physical space such as a laboratory.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">We aim to train our students to be critical learners through thinking routines to facilitate the development of their metacognition skills.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ENRICHMENT</b><br>Exciting learning journeys to Pulau Semakau and Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum serve as experiential learning opportunities for our students. Students learn beyond the classroom and laboratories, where they hear from professionals in niche areas and higher institutions of learning and research. We also engage local and overseas university professors and our very own TJC Alumni to give talks for our students to raise awareness on their career prospects, and enhance their scientific literacy.</p>
