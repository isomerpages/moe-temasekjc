# HUMANITIES

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Temasek Junior College, we aim to nurture critical thinkers who are curious about our world, and who are empathetic, independent and creative in thought. This is achieved through a rigorous curriculum across the different subjects. We challenge our students to make sense of the world by taking different perspectives and to communicate their arguments coherently in both speech and writing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our subjects deal with past and present real world issues using inquiry as a key cornerstone of our programmes. Each subject is grounded on a carefully planned core curriculum that focuses on real world application and critical thinking skills. To enhance the learning experience, multiple enrichment opportunities are available for students to stretch their learning beyond the classroom.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For students who have shown a strong passion and ability in the humanities, the Temasek Humanities Programme aims to stretch students with various leadership and enrichment opportunities for them to grow into action-oriented thought leaders for our nation.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you ever wondered why a packet of Hello Panda can cost a dollar in the canteen but over $4 at MBS? What about the economic fallout from COVID-19? The TJC Economics Department invites you to explore and make sense of the real world from the lens of an economist!</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CURRICULUM</b><br>In our Economics curriculum, students can look forward to embark on an investigation into how different economic agents – consumers, producers and governments – make decisions to achieve their objectives. Armed with tools of economic analysis to understand real world issues, evaluate perspectives and understand policy decisions, the Economics curriculum at TJC provides students with a strong foundation to manage and navigate the complexities and ambiguities of our ever-changing world. This rigorous approach towards the content and skills of the subject has led to consistent top Value-Adding results for our students in recent A-Level results!</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Our department is at the forefront of MOE’s Blended Learning initiative, using a Flipped Learning approach to integrate online teaching resources and face-to-face interactions to ensure that economics concepts and skills are accessible for all students. This has been well received by students and has been recognised in the national media.
