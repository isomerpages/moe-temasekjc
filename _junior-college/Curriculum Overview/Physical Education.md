# PHYSICAL EDUCATION

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through Physical Education, we aim to develop physically literate individuals who have the knowledge, skills and confidence to enjoy a lifelong appreciation of and participation in physical activity. Students learn to take ownership of their health as well as build social, psychomotor, and cognitive skills through a variety of sports, fitness and conditioning challenges and outdoor education.</p>

**CURRICULUM**

<p style="text-align: justify;">We have a robust PE curriculum where our students learn physical fitness and basic skills in a variety of sports and games. Students will be able to enjoy learning or playing three to four game modules over the two years.</p>
