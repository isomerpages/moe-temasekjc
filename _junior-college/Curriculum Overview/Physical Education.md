# PHYSICAL EDUCATION

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through Physical Education, we aim to develop physically literate individuals who have the knowledge, skills and confidence to enjoy a lifelong appreciation of and participation in physical activity. Students learn to take ownership of their health as well as build social, psychomotor, and cognitive skills through a variety of sports, fitness and conditioning challenges and outdoor education.</p>

**CURRICULUM**

<p style="text-align: justify;">We have a robust PE curriculum where our students learn physical fitness and basic skills in a variety of sports and games. Students will be able to enjoy learning or playing three to four game modules over the two years.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the Sports Education Programme (SEP), we organise special sports modules as post-exam activities. These include Inline Skating, Clay Target Shooting, Jiujitsu, Aikido and Archery, to broaden studentsâ€™ experience beyond PE lessons. Our students can also look forward to Inter-Class or Intra-Class Sports Tournaments where they pit their skills against their peers in friendly competitions and learn sportsmanship. In a normal year, students can also step up as leaders to organise, plan and manage games and activities during Games Day. Even so, despite the pandemic, our students continue to immerse in healthy living, as they take part in a Virtual Marathon and maintain their virtual workouts to keep themselves physically and mentally fit.</p>
