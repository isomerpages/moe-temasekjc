# MATHEMATICS
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Mathematics is the music of reason”, said mathematician James Joseph Sylvester. We believe a basic understanding of mathematics and statistics, and the ability to think mathematically and statistically, are essential for an educated and informed people. At Temasek Junior College, we offer a suite of 4 syllabuses, namely H1 Mathematics, H2 Mathematics, H2 Further Mathematics and H3 Mathematics. The suite is designed for different profiles of students, to provide them with options to learn mathematics at different levels and different degrees of specialisation, to support their desired choice of university courses. For instance, students who are keen to pursue engineering could offer ‘double mathematics’, that is, H2 Mathematics and H2 Further Mathematics. Students who are interested to pursue a course in business or social sciences can offer H1 Mathematics.</p>

**CURRICULUM**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Mathematics curriculum seeks to develop thinking, reasoning, communication and modelling skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving. They are taught to connect ideas within mathematics and apply mathematics in various disciplines in their tertiary studies. They are also guided to experience and appreciate the value of mathematics in life.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We create impactful HBL experiences that engage students in their learning of mathematics through fostering conceptual understanding by providing content with interactivity and different perspectives, and by providing a collaborative online learning environment.</p>

**ENRICHMENT**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students have the opportunity to take part in a wide variety of competitions, both world-wide and local. Examples of world-wide competitions are the Australian Mathematics Competition, the American Mathematics Competition, International Math Modeling Competition (Singapore) and the TI Shanghai Cup. Examples of local competitions are the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad, Singapore Statistical Poster Competition, Designing with TI Graphing Calculators competition, and interest-based competitions such as the Rubik’s Cube Competition.</p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students can also opt to take part in research programmes, such as the Research Mentoring Programme organised by SUTD and Research Attachment Programme by A*STAR.</p>
