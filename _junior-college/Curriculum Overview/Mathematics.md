# MATHEMATICS
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Mathematics is the music of reason”, said mathematician James Joseph Sylvester. We believe a basic understanding of mathematics and statistics, and the ability to think mathematically and statistically, are essential for an educated and informed people. At Temasek Junior College, we offer a suite of 4 syllabuses, namely H1 Mathematics, H2 Mathematics, H2 Further Mathematics and H3 Mathematics. The suite is designed for different profiles of students, to provide them with options to learn mathematics at different levels and different degrees of specialisation, to support their desired choice of university courses. For instance, students who are keen to pursue engineering could offer ‘double mathematics’, that is, H2 Mathematics and H2 Further Mathematics. Students who are interested to pursue a course in business or social sciences can offer H1 Mathematics.</p>
