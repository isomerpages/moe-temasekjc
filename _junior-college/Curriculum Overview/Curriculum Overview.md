<p>Overview of the GCE A-Level Curriculum</p>
<h4>SUBJECT COMBINATIONS</h4>
<p>We offer a wide range of subjects at H1 and H2 levels in different subject
combinations which have been carefully aligned to the GCE 'A' Level curriculum
to prepare students and allow them varied options for university courses.
Our subject combinations allow students to pursue their areas of interest
and to specialise in the domains of the Sciences or the Arts, but at the
same time maintaining a broad exposure, by offering contrasting subjects,
and building key knowledge skills via core subjects like General Paper
and Project Work. Eligible students can also offer subjects at H3 level
which present diverse learning opportunities for in-depth study.</p>
