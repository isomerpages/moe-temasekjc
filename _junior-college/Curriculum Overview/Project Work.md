# PROJECT WORK

<p style="text-align: justify;">As the world changes rapidly, and interconnected problems and challenges increase, our students, as important stakeholders of the future, need to gain awareness and take actions to construct solutions with positive impacts.</p>

**CURRICULUM**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Anchored on the framework of Design Thinking, Project Work in Temasek Junior College offers students a range of authentic learning experiences to explore and address both local and global issues, imbues them with the designer mindset and equips them with design thinking tools to solve real-world problems. We seek to engage, educate and enlighten our students so that, together, we can build a better future.</p>
