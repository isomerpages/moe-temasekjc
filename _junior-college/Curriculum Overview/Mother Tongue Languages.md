# MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES


<center><b>Ignite the Passion for our Mother Tongue Languages<br>
Be Sparkled by the Wonders of our Cultures</b></centeR>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We celebrate the diversity of the languages, and the rich cultures encapsulated within them. We are committed to developing our students’ bilingualism and broadening their horizons. By helping them grow in depth of thought and eloquence in communication, we prepare our students to be globally-ready individuals for the 21st Century world. We believe that the mastery of an additional language essentially bestows each one of our students with another set of wings to soar.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As shown in the diagram below, we offer a variety of Mother Tongue subjects at IP and JC levels respectively:</p>
