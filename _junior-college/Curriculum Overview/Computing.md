<p style="text-align: justify;">Our H2 Computing programme aims to infuse the broad ideas of systems thinking and computational thinking inherent in the study of Computing through a multi-dimensional approach of Computer <i>as a Tool, Computer in Society and Computer as a Science</i>.

Hence we do not believe in having a one-size-fits-all programme. Instead, we strive to provide a differentiated and enriched blended curriculum to ensure every student gets sufficient exposure appropriate to their progress, ultimately learning beyond the GCE A-Level curriculum.</p>
