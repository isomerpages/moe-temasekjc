# COMPUTING

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our H2 Computing programme aims to infuse the broad ideas of systems thinking and computational thinking inherent in the study of Computing through a multi-dimensional approach of Computer <i>as a Tool, Computer in Society and Computer as a Science</i>. Students will acquire 21st century skills from the use of various applications, and be cognizant of the ethical and legal issues arising from technology.</p>

**CURRICULUM**

<p style="text-align: justify;">In designing our programme, we follow closely the Computer Education Framework to ensure a balanced coverage between theory and practice through the learning of fundamental Computing concepts and principles, as well as the application of logical reasoning and problem-solving skills to practical contexts.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We fully understand that each student joining us comes with a different level of grounding in Computing. Hence we do not believe in having a one-size-fits-all programme. Instead, we strive to provide a differentiated and enriched blended curriculum to ensure every student gets sufficient exposure appropriate to their progress, ultimately learning beyond the GCE A-Level curriculum.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We do this through a carefully selected blend of pedagogical approaches such the ones illustrated below:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We create the authentic learning settings you need to apply relevant computing concepts and computational thinking skills to create solutions, helping you to grow into critical thinkers and innovators adept in resolving complex problems. Our rigorous debugging and program refinement challenges will also give you the additional push to develop perseverance and resilience. Opportunities to collaborate and communicate effectively are also aplenty.</p>

**ENRICHMENT**

<p style="text-align: justify;">We curate enrichment opportunities that are appropriate to your competencies and interest to provide you a holistic learning experience beyond the classroom. These include local and global competitions, opportunities to learn from AI Singapore + Data Camp, MongoDB University and to attend conferences and forums such as FOSSASIA, BuildingBloCS and PyConSG.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Eligible Singapore Citizens who are students enrolled in H2 Computing can also apply for the <a href="https://www.csit.gov.sg/internships-scholarships/csit-computing-scholarship" target="_blank"><b>CSIT Computing Scholarship</b></a>, which aims to encourage and nurture young talents in pursuing an education and future career in the dynamic and evolving infocomm industry.</p>
