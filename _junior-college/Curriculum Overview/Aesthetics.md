<h1>AESTHETICS</h1>
<p>Our Aesthetics programmes offer students the creative and academic platform
to express their ideas through the various aesthetics mediums. The Aesthetics
at Temasek Junior College comprises the subjects Art (JC1 and JC2) and
the Music Elective Programme (IP1-JC2). Students will not only be trained
to become competent in their various aesthetic disciplines, but will also
be challenged to be critical, analytical, collaborative and creative thinkers.
As students bring forth their abstract ideas to connect their inner world
to the outer world of concrete reality, they will make a meaningful impact
on our world, while learning the relevance of being human beings with an
aesthetic sensibility.</p>

<li>
<p>ART</p>
<p>The Art Programme at TJC is an artistic journey for passionate explorations,
discoveries and sharing of artistic concepts and ideas. Art students will
find their own artistic and creative inclinations, styles and techniques
to express themselves in the most powerful way. Students will also discover
and traverse through a journey of self-discovery, time management as well
as creative and critical thinking.</p>

<p>MUSIC</p>
<p>The <a href="/academic/special-programmes/music-elective-programme" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Music Elective Programme (MEP)</a> at
Temasek Junior College nurtures each student in their musical inclinations
while developing them to be critical and creative thinkers, performers
and composers of music. Enriching and extensive learning experiences in
the study and application of Music are provided to enable students to attain
advanced levels of musicianship, and to deepen their passion and understanding.
Each student will become a musician in the truest sense of the word – as
an analyst, composer, performer, critic, and researcher.</p>
<p><strong>CURRICULUM</strong> 
<br>Our syllabus approaches the study of Music through Music Studies and Music
Making. Students will learn different components of the paper, namely Asian
Music, Western Music, Composition (Stylistic imitation and Free composition),
and will also have lecture recitals and personal consultations for their
performing component. They will acquire essential 21st Century music skills
in music technology, such as music notation software and sound recording,
in the process of creating their individual composition portfolios.</p>
<p>TJC’s MEP also offers H3 Music, an intellectually challenging course which
exposes students to a wider scope of music as a discipline, and taught
via a multi-dimensional approach to elicit discussion and critical thinking.</p>
