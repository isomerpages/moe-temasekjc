# AESTHETICS

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Aesthetics programmes offer students the creative and academic platform to express their ideas through the various aesthetics mediums. The Aesthetics at Temasek Junior College comprises the subjects Art (JC2) and the Music Elective Programme (IP1-JC2). Students will not only be trained to become competent in their various aesthetic disciplines, but will also be challenged to be critical, analytical, collaborative and creative thinkers. As students bring forth their abstract ideas to connect their inner world to the outer world of concrete reality, they will make a meaningful impact on our world, while learning the relevance of being human beings with an aesthetic sensibility.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Art Programme at TJC is an artistic journey for passionate explorations, discoveries and sharing of artistic concepts and ideas. Art students will find their own artistic and creative inclinations, styles and techniques to express themselves in the most powerful way. Students will also discover and traverse through a journey of self-discovery, time management as well as creative and critical thinking.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CURRICULUM</b><br>Art students will be exposed to various forms of representations, artists and artworks in the Study of Visual Arts (SOVA) and explore a wide range of artistic media during studio and coursework sessions in 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional praxis. The SOVA component addresses and challenges students’ visual literacy skills, studio, and coursework sessions reflect students’ artistic journey, documenting the process that leads up to a final work of art.</p>

</b><br>This committee aims to support in the planning and implementation of College-initiated or PEERS-initiated activities that may be organised during the year. Such events may arise due to special occasions (e.g. commemorative events).</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>INTEREST GROUP</b><br>Students will get the opportunity to visit various museums and exhibitions in Singapore pertinent to the area of study. There are also opportunities for students to volunteer at various art events. In further enriching our students’ experience, they will also be engaged in competitions such as UOB Painting of the Year and the Singapore Youth Festival. Where relevant, students will also attend talks or seminars that expose them to local and foreign artists, so that they deepen their artistic skills and gain industry insights.</p>
