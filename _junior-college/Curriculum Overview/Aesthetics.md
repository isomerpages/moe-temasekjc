# AESTHETICS

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Aesthetics programmes offer students the creative and academic platform to express their ideas through the various aesthetics mediums. The Aesthetics at Temasek Junior College comprises the subjects Art (JC2) and the Music Elective Programme (IP1-JC2). Students will not only be trained to become competent in their various aesthetic disciplines, but will also be challenged to be critical, analytical, collaborative and creative thinkers. As students bring forth their abstract ideas to connect their inner world to the outer world of concrete reality, they will make a meaningful impact on our world, while learning the relevance of being human beings with an aesthetic sensibility.</p>

Students will also discover and traverse through a journey of self-discovery, time management as well as creative and critical thinking.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="/academic/special-programmes/music-elective-programme">Music Elective Programme (MEP)</a> at Temasek Junior College nurtures each student in their musical inclinations while developing them to be critical and creative thinkers, performers and composers of music. Enriching and extensive learning experiences in the study and application of Music are provided to enable students to attain advanced levels of musicianship, and to deepen their passion and understanding. Each student will become a musician in the truest sense of the word – as an analyst, composer, performer, critic, and researcher.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CURRICULUM</b><br>Our syllabus approaches the study of Music through Music Studies and Music Making. Students will learn different components of the paper, namely Asian Music, Western Music, Composition (Stylistic imitation and Free composition), and will also have lecture recitals and personal consultations for their performing component. They will acquire essential 21st Century music skills in music technology, such as music notation software and sound recording, in the process of creating their individual composition portfolios.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">TJC’s MEP also offers H3 Music, an intellectually challenging course which exposes students to a wider scope of music as a discipline, and taught via a multi-dimensional approach to elicit discussion and critical thinking.</p>
