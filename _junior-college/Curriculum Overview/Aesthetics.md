# AESTHETICS

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Aesthetics programmes offer students the creative and academic platform to express their ideas through the various aesthetics mediums. The Aesthetics at Temasek Junior College comprises the subjects Art (JC2) and the Music Elective Programme (IP1-JC2). Students will not only be trained to become competent in their various aesthetic disciplines, but will also be challenged to be critical, analytical, collaborative and creative thinkers. As students bring forth their abstract ideas to connect their inner world to the outer world of concrete reality, they will make a meaningful impact on our world, while learning the relevance of being human beings with an aesthetic sensibility.</p>
