# AESTHETICS

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Aesthetics programmes offer students the creative and academic platform to express their ideas through the various aesthetics mediums. The Aesthetics at Temasek Junior College comprises the subjects Art (JC2) and the Music Elective Programme (IP1-JC2). Students will not only be trained to become competent in their various aesthetic disciplines, but will also be challenged to be critical, analytical, collaborative and creative thinkers. As students bring forth their abstract ideas to connect their inner world to the outer world of concrete reality, they will make a meaningful impact on our world, while learning the relevance of being human beings with an aesthetic sensibility.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Art Programme at TJC is an artistic journey for passionate explorations, discoveries and sharing of artistic concepts and ideas. Art students will find their own artistic and creative inclinations, styles and techniques to express themselves in the most powerful way. Students will also discover and traverse through a journey of self-discovery, time management as well as creative and critical thinking.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CURRICULUM</b><br>Art students will be exposed to various forms of representations, artists and artworks in the Study of Visual Arts (SOVA) and explore a wide range of artistic media during studio and coursework sessions in 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional praxis. The SOVA component addresses and challenges students’ visual literacy skills, studio, and coursework sessions reflect students’ artistic journey, documenting the process that leads up to a final work of art.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Music Elective Programme (MEP) at Temasek Junior College nurtures each student in their musical inclinations while developing them to be critical and creative thinkers, performers and composers of music. Enriching and extensive learning experiences in the study and application of Music are provided to enable students to attain advanced levels of musicianship, and to deepen their passion and understanding. Each student will become a musician in the truest sense of the word – as an analyst, composer, performer, critic, and researcher.</p>
