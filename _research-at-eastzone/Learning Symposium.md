# LEARNING SYMPOSIUM

## ABOUT THE EAST ZONE LEARNING SYMPOSIUM


<p style="text-align: justify;">Temasek Junior College hosts the biennial East Zone Learning Symposium, a gathering of teachers who are passionate about sharing their good practices and learning from other practitioners. The keynote address is usually delivered by a prominent luminary from the National Institute of Education, which is followed by two sets of breakout sessions anchored by our very own teachers in the East Zone schools.</p>
