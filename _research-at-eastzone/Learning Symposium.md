# LEARNING SYMPOSIUM

## ABOUT THE EAST ZONE LEARNING SYMPOSIUM


<p style="text-align: justify;">Temasek Junior College hosts the biennial East Zone Learning Symposium, a gathering of teachers who are passionate about sharing their good practices and learning from other practitioners. The keynote address is usually delivered by a prominent luminary from the National Institute of Education, which is followed by two sets of breakout sessions anchored by our very own teachers in the East Zone schools.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>SYNOPSIS OF KEYNOTE ADDRESS</b><br>In this presentation, I will share some trends in society and education likely to change assessment practice. We will examine the impact and potential of new digital technologies, the rise of big data and Artificial Intelligence, transformations in the workplace, and trends in educational assessment. As schools and classrooms move toward more inclusive forms of education; personalised and student-driven learning; 21stcentury competencies; and enhanced problem-solving, creative and critical thinking and citizenship skills, what are the implications for assessment? The need to reimagine assessment that goes beyond top-down and standardised approaches, examinations, sorting students and assessing routine cognitive skills seems more important than ever. The presentation will share insights from research and on assessment approaches and tools to support student learning in the 21st century.</p>
