# ABOUT RESEARCH@EASTZONE

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Temasek Junior College, our students are at the heart of all we do. This is the primary motivation for our teachers to innovate and continue to improve in Teaching and Learning, with support of educational research. Bearing testimony to this enterprising spirit of the College and the commitment and dedication of staff members, the College was earmarked as the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Research in 2008, enabling fellow teachers to enhance their teaching through educational research.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2014, our research centre became an affiliated organisation of ALARA (Action Learning, Action Research Association Inc) founded in 1991, providing support for teachers who want to share their research projects through the association's journal and at world conferences.</p>
