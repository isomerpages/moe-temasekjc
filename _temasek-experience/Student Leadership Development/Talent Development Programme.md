### Talent Development Programme

![](/images/TDP%20Masthead.jpg)

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here at TJC, we believe that students should have the agency and ability to take charge of their own future as potential leaders of tomorrow. TJC’s Talent Development Programme (TDP) thus provides a supportive environment where students are given the opportunity to develop themselves as individuals, and challenged to grow as thoughtful and confident leaders.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our programme is guided by our mission of being an ACE student leader- an Active Learner, a Caring and Committed Citizen, and an Ethical Leader.</p>

### CONNECT SESSIONS

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our  <b>CONNECT sessions</b> give students an opportunity to clarify their leadership philosophy through sharing and discussion with fellow student leaders. From these sessions, TDP students graduate with a strong conviction in their leadership beliefs and values, which ground them as they continue on their leadership journeys.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>The TDP also curates a variety of <b>community leadership projects</b> that our students can get involved in. These projects enable our students to lead their peers in serving various communities in need, and are valuable learning opportunities for TDP students to test their leadership mettle.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify;">To succeed as a future leader of tomorrow, the TDP also supports our students in deepening their understanding of current domestic and international affairs. Our <b>Alumni Mentoring</b> initiative gives students an insider's view into various industries and sectors, and our <b>Public Service Preparatory Programme (PSPP)</b> builds a critical appreciation of the challenges and opportunities facing Singapore in today's world.

With the opportunities and support offered through the TDP, students can be assured of a strong programme that will strengthen their leadership skills and build a robust portfolio. We are confident that the TDP will equip our students with the necessary skills and character to navigate and thrive in today’s increasingly volatile and complex world.
