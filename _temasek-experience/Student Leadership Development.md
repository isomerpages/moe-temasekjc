## TALENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME

![](/images/TDP%20Masthead.jpg)

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here at TJC, we believe that students should have the agency and ability to take charge of their own future as potential leaders of tomorrow. TJC’s Talent Development Programme (TDP) thus provides a supportive environment where students are given the opportunity to develop themselves as individuals, and challenged to grow as thoughtful and confident leaders.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our programme is guided by our mission of being an ACE student leader- an Active Learner, a Caring and Committed Citizen, and an Ethical Leader.</p>

### CONNECT SESSIONS

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our CONNECT sessions  give students an opportunity to clarify their leadership philosophy through sharing and discussion with fellow student leaders. From these sessions, TDP students graduate with a strong conviction in their leadership beliefs and values, which ground them as they continue on their leadership journeys.</p>
