# STUDENT LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT

<p style="text-align: justify;">In TJC, we consider every student to be a potential leader. We believe every TJCian is a leader, every day and everywhere. We aim to develop ACE student leaders by developing our students progressively in key leadership competencies. We deliver learning experiences for our students to sharpen their skills set as they progress from personal leadership to team leadership, and to thought leadership.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether our students step up to take on different roles and responsibilities - from the classroom to co-curricular activities to the community represent the College on the academic or sporting front, or embark on some enterprise - the opportunities to showcase their talents are aplenty.</p>

**THE LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE**

<p style="text-align: justify;">TJC uses James Kouzes and Barry Posner’s The Leadership Challenge model, which is backed by over 25 years of research and data of over three million leaders. Based on case studies of leaders about their personal best experiences as leaders, Kouzes and Posner came up with a pattern of behaviours and actions used by people when they are most effective as leaders, encapsulated by the Five Practices – Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act, and Encourage the Heart. This tool enables students to chart their own leadership growth and hone their leadership competencies.</p>
