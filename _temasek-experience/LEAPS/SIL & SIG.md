<h3>STUDENT-INITIATED LEARNING</h3>
<p>SIL is a journey for students to explore their interests outside of the
curriculum. We encourage them to use this opportunity to grow their passion,
curiosity and hone essential life skills! Students will develop their SIL
projects using the SPARKLE framework, which encourages intentional development
of breadth and depth of skills.</p>
<p>In general, students may use 1hr of their HBL time every fortnight to
work on their SIL projects, journal the process, and reflect on their experience.
We culminate with a celebration of learning at the end of the year with
class-based SIL showcases.</p>

<h4>STUDENT INTEREST GROUP</h4>
<p>Our SIGs empower like-minded students across different levels to come
together, explore shared passions, and take the lead in shaping their own
learning experiences. SIG student leaders initiate, plan, and execute meaningful
activities that resonate with their interests. This platform encourages
Learning for Life and offers a vibrant learning community beyond the classroom.</p>
