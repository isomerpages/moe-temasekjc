<h3>VALUES IN ACTION</h3>
<p><strong>At Temasek Junior College, we are uniquely positioned to nurture our students across a six-year learning journey.</strong></p>
<p>During the <strong>Integrated Programme (IP1–4)</strong>, our focus is
on cultivating empathy that leads to action. Students build strong foundations
through guided experiences that help them understand diverse perspectives,
develop a sense of purpose, and gain the confidence to contribute to their
community meaningfully.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Junior College years (JC1–2)</strong>, the emphasis shifts
towards developing awareness into advocacy. Students deepen their understanding
of the world around them, take greater ownership of their learning, collaborate
with peers, and act with influence and impact.</p>
<p>Across all six years, we place strong emphasis on personal learning and
reflection, anchored in our core competencies and learning outcomes. Our
aim is to help every student grow with intention, compassion, and a readiness
to make a positive difference.</p>
