# CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES

<p style="text-align: justify;">Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) are an important platform for our students to develop their personal and moral character. Our Personal Development, Character and Leadership, and Values-in-Action programmes help students discover and pursue their interests. We believe in holistic development that includes academic excellence, a love for community, creativity, adventure and entrepreneurship.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is compulsory for all students to join a CCA, even if a student has joined or intend to join an external CCA. Beyond their classroom interactions, CCA is an important avenue for students to interact with students from other classes and levels. Every year, intra-school and inter-school competitions and performances provide students with opportunities to showcase their skills and learn to collaborate in teams.</p>
