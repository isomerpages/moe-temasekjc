# STUDENTS' COUNCIL

Betterment through Dedication – this motto aptly captures the essence of the Students’ Council (SC), the highest office that any student can hold in TJC. The SC comprises student leaders from IP Year 2 to JC2 who are committed and passionate about making the College a vibrant and enjoyable second home for TJCians through College-wide and House activities.


As student leaders, these councillors leads in the planning and executing of key events, and will be trained as mentors and facilitators at various platforms such as dialogues, focus group discussions and seminars.
