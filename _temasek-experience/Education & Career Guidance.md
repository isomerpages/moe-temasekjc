<h1>EDUCATION &amp; CAREER GUIDANCE</h1>
<p>TJC has a comprehensive Education and Career Guidance (ECG) curriculum.
Students can access the <a href="https://ecg.temasekjc.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Education and Career Guidance website</a><strong> </strong>to
obtain the necessary information and guidance to stand them in good stead
to achieve their aspirations while they are in TJC or even when they have
graduated. ECG counselling is also available at the Temasek Guidance Hub
.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TJC offers numerous opportunities for students to explore the infinite
possibilities of what life can hold for them when they graduate. We conduct
workshops and classes on how to write an effective Statement and how to
sit for an interview. Students will also have the opportunity to hear from
various agencies about the scholarships they offer and clarify questions
they have about studying in the local autonomous universities. TJC also
invites alumni and representatives from overseas universities to share
with our students on what studying overseas is like.</p>

<p>Annually, TJC organises the Careers, Scholarships and Higher Education
(CSHE) Fair, which consists of career talks and an exhibition with participating
organisations from both public and private sectors.</p>
<p><strong>TEMASEK INTERNSHIP PROGRAMME</strong>
</p>
<p>We also offers an internship programme for our JC students to immerse
themselves in their areas of interest in terms of career options so as
to be better informed of their higher education choices. Through this internship,
held during the Nov-Dec school holidays, students gain valuable first-hand
experience of their chosen careers. They are mentored and nurtured by leading
practitioners in their respective fields â€“ many of whom are alumni of the
College. The agencies involved represent a broad spectrum of careers and
specialities, including architecture, bio-technology, law, social work,
theatre, infocomm technology, the media, veterinary sciences, and many
others.</p>
