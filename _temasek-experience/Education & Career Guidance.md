# EDUCATION & CAREER GUIDANCE

<p style="text-align: justify;">TJC has a comprehensive Education and Career Guidance (ECG) curriculum. The <a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/uspo" target="_blank"><b>University, Scholarship and Placement Office (USPO)</b></a> provides students with career counselling and scholarship advisories to stand them in good stead to achieve their aspirations.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">TJC offers numerous opportunities for students to explore the infinite possibilities of what life can hold for them when they graduate. We conduct workshops and classes on how to write an effective Statement and how to sit for an interview. Students will also have the opportunity to hear from various agencies about the scholarships they offer and clarify questions they have about studying in the local autonomous universities. TJC also invites alumni and representatives from overseas universities to share with our students on what studying overseas is like.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Annually, TJC organises the Careers, Scholarships and Higher Education (CSHE) Fair, which consists of career talks and an exhibition with participating organisations from both public and private sectors.</p>

  

**TEMASEK INTERNSHIP PROGRAMME**

<p style="text-align: justify;">We also offers an internship programme for our JC students to immerse themselves in their areas of interest in terms of career options so as to be better informed of their higher education choices. Through this internship, held during the Nov-Dec school holidays, students gain valuable first-hand experience of their chosen careers. They are mentored and nurtured by leading practitioners in their respective fields – many of whom are alumni of the College. The agencies involved represent a broad spectrum of careers and specialities, including architecture, bio-technology, law, social work, theatre, infocomm technology, the media, veterinary sciences, and many others.</p>
