<h1>SEXUALITY EDUCATION (JC)</h1>
<h2>OVERVIEW (JC1 &amp; JC2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MOE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS (JC)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships with others, including
those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the
family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Goals </strong>of Sexuality Education are to:
<br>
<br>a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>c) Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p></p>
<p>a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p></p>
<p>b) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the
foundation for strong families);</p>
<p></p>
<p>c) Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p></p>
<p>d) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

<p><em>Are values such as abstinence of sexual activity before marriage still valid in the world today? Why? Is abstinence a reasonable choice?</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this lesson, students examine issues related to abstinence and explore
the balance between being free to make personal choices and being responsible
for the consequences of their choices. They will understand that, in the
face of conflicting voices and perspectives, they need to focus on integrity,
and choose to act in accordance with sound values and moral principles.
In so doing, they learn to make responsible decisions for self and others,
and think through the consequences of doing so.</p>

<p>Students will examine the relationship between rights and responsibilities

sexual crimes, and the legal consequences of inappropriate sexual behaviour.
They will examine what makes voyeurism wrong, learn the importance of the
law as signposts for desired behaviours and conduct in society, and the
importance of one’s moral compass in responsible decision-making and choosing
to do what is right.</p>

<p>This lesson will help students recognise that some segments of society
may inaccurately reflect the efforts needed to maintain healthy relationships,
leading to skewed assumptions of sexual messages and connotations within
relationships. Students will understand how societal influences can skew
one’s understanding of gender stereotypes (e.g. boys should not cry, and
are to suppress emotional sensitivity so as not to seem weak; girls are
physically weak and unathletic, and downplay achievements so as to fit
in).</p>
