<h1>SEXUALITY EDUCATION (JC)</h1>
<h2>OVERVIEW (JC1 &amp; JC2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>MOE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS (JC)</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to students to understand the
physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature,
develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with others,
including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the
importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging
healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended
family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for
the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities
in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Goals </strong>of Sexuality Education are to:
<br>
<br>a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>c) Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p></p>
<p>a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p></p>
<p>b) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the
foundation for strong families);</p>
<p></p>
<p>c) Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p></p>
<p>d) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

<p><em>Are values such as abstinence of sexual activity before marriage still valid in the world today? Why? Is abstinence a reasonable choice?</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this lesson, students examine issues related to abstinence and explore
the balance between being free to make personal choices and being responsible
for the consequences of their choices. They will understand that, in the
face of conflicting voices and perspectives, they need to focus on integrity,
and choose to act in accordance with sound values and moral principles.</p>
<p>In so doing, students learn to make responsible decisions for self and
others, and think through the consequences of doing so.</p>

<p>In this lesson, students examine issues related to abortion and the impact
of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and understand that one has
to make responsible decisions for both self and others.</p>
<p>Students are also taught to consider sexual abstinence before marriage
to remove any risks that come with casual sex. The lesson will also focus
on being a source of support for others who may be pregnant or have STIs.</p>

and responsibilities by exploring societal expectations, the laws that
protect teenagers from sexual crimes, and the legal consequences of inappropriate
sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>Students will examine what makes voyeurism wrong, learn the importance
of the law as signposts for desired behaviours and conduct in society,
and the importance of one’s moral compass in responsible decision-making
and choosing to do what is right.</p>

<p>In this lesson, students will recognise that some segments of society
may inaccurately reflect the efforts needed to maintain healthy relationships,
leading to skewed assumptions of sexual messages and connotations within
relationships.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students will understand how societal influences can skew one’s understanding
of gender stereotypes (e.g. boys should not cry, and are to suppress emotional
sensitivity so as not to seem weak; girls are physically weak and unathletic,
and downplay achievements so as to fit in), which can affect interactions
and relationships in ways that are harmful to themselves and others.</p>
