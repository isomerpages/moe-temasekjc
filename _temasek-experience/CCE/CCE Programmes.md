3# CHARACTER & CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION

<p style="text-align: justify;">TJC is committed to nurturing good citizens who uphold our motto, “For College, For Nation”. Our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme comprises the learning of core values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions, with a focus on developing students to participate actively in community.</p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our CCE curriculum is purposefully implemented through a variety of learning platforms including CCE lessons, key student Development Experiences, school-based and student-led initiatives. As TJCians step out into the world, we are confident that they will continue to contribute to the both local and global communities with a spirit of compassion and service.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">We have Peer Support Leaders who are trained in various life-skills such as understanding emotions to look out for distressed peers, and assisting the College in providing a caring environment.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, every IP class has a Cyberwellness Ambassador. Cyberwellness Ambassadors deliver critical cyberwellness messages to their peers in class and at school, and help the College provide a safe environment by positively influencing their peers to navigate the cyberspace safely.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Citizenship Education program strives to help TJCians appreciate what it means to be a Singaporean. We leverage on our Citizenship programmes as platforms for students to demonstrate leadership qualities by customising activities for the entire cohort during National Education Commemorative Days. These experiences empower students to be active participants in community and national life both now and in the future.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">We also encourage our students to contribute meaningfully to the greater community, guided by our core College value of Compassion. Our students participate in Go Green Day, an annual event in which they collect used clothing and newspapers from residents in the Bedok and Chai Chee neighbourhoods. Every year, the collection raises more than $15,000 for the Lions' Home for the Elders and Assisi Hospice.</p>
