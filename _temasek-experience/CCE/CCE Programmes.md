# CHARACTER & CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION

<p style="text-align: justify;">TJC is committed to nurturing good citizens who uphold our motto, “For College, For Nation”. Our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme comprises the learning of core values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions, with a focus on developing students to participate actively in community.</p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our CCE curriculum is purposefully implemented through a variety of learning platforms including CCE lessons, key student Development Experiences, school-based and student-led initiatives. As TJCians step out into the world, we are confident that they will continue to contribute to the both local and global communities with a spirit of compassion and service.</p>
