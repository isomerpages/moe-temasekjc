# STUDENT WELL-BEING

<p style="text-align: justify;">We believe in the holistic development of all students and are dedicated to ensuring the well-being of TJCians so that they can develop into healthy and well-rounded individuals. Through self-management and development programmes such as the weekly Guidance lessons, tutor-student conferencing sessions as well as direct counselling sessions, we guide students to regard the challenges they face as opportunities for growth.</p>

<center>Our teachers believe in providing a caring and enabling learning environment by nurturing a sense of belonging, guiding students to appreciate diversity, and empowering them to be active learners.</center>
