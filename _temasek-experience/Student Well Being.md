<h1>STUDENT WELL-BEING</h1>
<p>We believe in the holistic development of all students and are dedicated
to ensuring the well-being of TJCians so that they can develop into healthy
and well-rounded individuals. Through self-management and development programmes
such as the weekly ACE lessons, tutor-student conferencing sessions as
well as direct counselling sessions, we guide students to regard the challenges
they face as opportunities for growth.</p>

<p>Our teachers believe in providing a caring and enabling learning environment
by nurturing a sense of belonging, guiding students to appreciate diversity,
