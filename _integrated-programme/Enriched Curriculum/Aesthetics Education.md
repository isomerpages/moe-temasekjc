# AESTHETICS EDUCATION

<p style="text-align: justify;">TJC’s Aesthetics Education empowers our students to express ideas, emotions and concepts through the application of elements and skills derived from the visual arts, the spoken and written language, music and bodily movements. In the first two years, students will immerse themselves in Visual Arts, Drama, Music and Dance modules. Students will achieve foundational literacy in the various forms of aesthetics expression, and develop their critical thinking, expressivity as well as self-confidence and perseverance. What makes our modules exciting for students is that they get the chance to adopt a practitioner’s lens at the individual and group levels: they have to think like an artist, an actor or director, a dancer and choreographer, and musician or song arranger. Through the Aesthetics curriculum, students will discover a new perspective of themselves and understand why the arts remain such an integral part of society and humanity.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CURRICULUM</b><br>The key pedagogies used to realize our students’ potential and expressiveness include the Understanding by Design (UbD) framework, experiential learning, collaborative learning and Inquiry-based learning (IBL). Each module that our students experience will enable them to chart their learning through a process that involves constant and deep self-reflection, exchanging and negotiating of ideas with their peers, and working with the feedback and guidance provided by our tutors and mentors. This process is vital for them to understand that every art form requires a rigorous process before meaning is effectively created for viewers. Each module would then culminate in a performance or showcase of their ideas and artistic product through the relevant Aesthetics mode and media (Visual Arts, Drama, Music or Dance).

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ENRICHMENT</b><br>Experiencing the Aesthetics – viewing, listening, doing and expressing – is essential to the effective learning of the various aesthetic modules. Where relevant, students will embark on field trips to museums, watch performances that allow them to see practitioners at work and attend artist seminars or talks.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href=""></a> Innovative in its interdisciplinary approach, the TJC [**Music Elective Programme (MEP)**](https://www.temasekjc.moe.edu.sg/academic/special-programmes/music-elective-programme) for IP students guides them to explore music in relation to art, literature, politics, religion and theatre. Students are exposed to music repertoire of both the Western traditions and non-Western traditions. This emphasis on multi-culturalism allows for the appreciation, analysis and critique of a diverse spectrum of works, and equips each student to be a musician skilled in analysis, composition, performing and research. <br><br>Refer to this page for more information: <a href="/academic/special-programmes/music-elective-programme">Music Elective Programme (MEP)</a></p>
