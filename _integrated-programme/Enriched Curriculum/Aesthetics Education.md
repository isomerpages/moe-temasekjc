# AESTHETICS EDUCATION

<p style="text-align: justify;">TJC’s Aesthetics Education empowers our students to express ideas, emotions and concepts through the application of elements and skills derived from the visual arts, the spoken and written language, music and bodily movements. In the first two years, students will immerse themselves in Visual Arts, Drama, Music and Dance modules. Students will achieve foundational literacy in the various forms of aesthetics expression, and develop their critical thinking, expressivity as well as self-confidence and perseverance. What makes our modules exciting for students is that they get the chance to adopt a practitioner’s lens at the individual and group levels: they have to think like an artist, an actor or director, a dancer and choreographer, and musician or song arranger. Through the Aesthetics curriculum, students will discover a new perspective of themselves and understand why the arts remain such an integral part of society and humanity.</p>
