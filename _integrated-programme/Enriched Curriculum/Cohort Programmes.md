# COHORT PROGRAMMES

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cohort Programmes extend our students' learning beyond the classroom. Designed to give all students the opportunity to experience Type I and II enrichment under the Renzulli Enrichment Triad framework, they provide opportunities for students to apply what they have learned in authentic and dynamic environments. Through our cohort programmes, students learn future-ready skills, develop a deep understanding of the world around them, and grow into confident, forward-thinking leaders who are anchored in a sense of community. Most of all, these hands-on programmes encourage students to experience the joy of learning and discovery in engaging and exciting ways!</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Sabbatical Week gives students the time and space to discover their interests through a range of enrichment activities, programmes, workshops and talks. Through these, students are exposed to new topics and skills, thereby stretching them beyond what they learn in the classroom. Sabbatical activities are designed to be hands-on, thought-provoking and to inspire students to continue exploring a wide range of topics and ideas.</p>

    <td><p style="text-align: justify;">Students participated in <b>hands-on modules which showed them how key concepts for the core subjects could be applied in authentic situations</b>. The modules, designed by TJC teachers, included: learning Biology, Physics and Chemistry concepts through making ice cream; learning to draw and perform graphic notational scores for Music; creating podcasts of book and film reviews for Language Arts; going on a virtual learning journey to the Singapore River for Fundamental Humanities; and learning about mathematical concepts and probability through playing UNO.</p></td>

This intensive and lively workshop trained students in critical thinking, argumentation and speaking skills – an excellent complement to the skills that students are learning in subjects such as Fundamental Humanities and Language Arts. Students had many opportunities to showcase their persuasive speaking skills through participating in hands-on debates.</p></td>

This programme introduced students to key philosophical concepts and ideas, such as scepticism, deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics. Students explored these ideas through lectures, film screenings, and mini-projects.</p></td>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">In WwB, IP Year 2 students investigate communities and neighbourhoods in Singapore using a combination of a thematic approach, design thinking and ethnographic methodologies. They ultimately arrive at a deep and insightful understanding of the factors which make up the community: its tensions, why it has evolved in this manner, and how the community continues to adapt to the changing times. Through this programme, students acquire tools and dispositions that allow them to understand the world around them with empathy, insight and perceptiveness. This will stand them in good stead as global citizens in a complex and ever-changing world.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Innovation and Research Project (IRP) is a cutting-edge design thinking programme inspired by Stanford University's Hasso Plattner Institute of Design or more popularly known as d.school, and the award-winning design firm IDEO. The Design Thinking approach seeks to solve problems by first understanding users' needs, followed by the development of insights to meet those needs. In IRP, our students unlock their inner creativity and take an interdisciplinary approach that is empathy-driven and end-user centric to address the most complex problems. Through the IRP, our IP Year 3 students will understand the basics of design thinking and engage in actual innovation that meet users' needs, wants and desires.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"> The TJC Wonder.Observe.Weave! (W.O.W!) programme is one of TJC's niche programmes for our Year 4 students. Through collaboration with partners who are leaders in their fields of study or industry professionals in more than 40 projects, IP Year 4 students are provided with opportunities to embark on interdisciplinary projects which enable them to assimilate and apply knowledge gained in the classroom to real-world contexts. In the process, they hone soft and hard skills, gain invaluable insight into the demands of a particular industry and develop a higher level of metacognition when attempting to solve a given problem.</p>
