# COHORT PROGRAMMES

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cohort Programmes <b>extend our students' learning beyond the classroom</b>. Designed to give all students the opportunity to experience Type I and II enrichment under the Renzulli Enrichment Triad framework, they provide opportunities for students to apply what they have learned in <b>authentic and dynamic environments</b>. Through our cohort programmes, students learn future-ready skills, develop a deep understanding of the world around them, and grow into confident, forward-thinking leaders who are anchored in a sense of community. Most of all, these hands-on programmes encourage students to experience the joy of learning and discovery in engaging and exciting ways!</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Sabbatical Week gives students the time and space to discover their interests through a range of enrichment activities, programmes, workshops and talks. Through these, students are exposed to new topics and skills, thereby stretching them beyond what they learn in the classroom. Sabbatical activities are designed to be hands-on, thought-provoking and to inspire students to continue exploring a wide range of topics and ideas.</p>
