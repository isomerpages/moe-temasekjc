# COHORT PROGRAMMES

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cohort Programmes <b>extend our students' learning beyond the classroom</b>. Designed to give all students the opportunity to experience Type I and II enrichment under the Renzulli Enrichment Triad framework, they provide opportunities for students to apply what they have learned in <b>authentic and dynamic environments</b>. Through our cohort programmes, students learn future-ready skills, develop a deep understanding of the world around them, and grow into confident, forward-thinking leaders who are anchored in a sense of community. Most of all, these hands-on programmes encourage students to experience the joy of learning and discovery in engaging and exciting ways!</p>
