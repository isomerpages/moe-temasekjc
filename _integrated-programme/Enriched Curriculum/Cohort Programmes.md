# COHORT PROGRAMMES

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cohort Programmes <b>extend our students' learning beyond the classroom</b>. Designed to give all students the opportunity to experience Type I and II enrichment under the Renzulli Enrichment Triad framework, they provide opportunities for students to apply what they have learned in <b>authentic and dynamic environments</b>. Through our cohort programmes, students learn future-ready skills, develop a deep understanding of the world around them, and grow into confident, forward-thinking leaders who are anchored in a sense of community. Most of all, these hands-on programmes encourage students to experience the joy of learning and discovery in engaging and exciting ways!</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Sabbatical Week gives students the time and space to discover their interests through a range of enrichment activities, programmes, workshops and talks. Through these, students are exposed to new topics and skills, thereby stretching them beyond what they learn in the classroom. Sabbatical activities are designed to be hands-on, thought-provoking and to inspire students to continue exploring a wide range of topics and ideas.</p>

    <td><b>IP Year 1</b></td>
    <td><p style="text-align: justify;">Students participated in hands-on modules which showed them how key concepts for the core subjects could be applied in authentic situations. The modules, designed by TJC teachers, included: learning Biology, Physics and Chemistry concepts through making ice cream; learning to draw and perform graphic notational scores for Music; creating podcasts of book and film reviews for Language Arts; going on a virtual learning journey to the Singapore River for Fundamental Humanities; and learning about mathematical concepts and probability through playing UNO.</p></td>

    <td><b>IP Year 2</b></td>
    <td><p style="text-align: justify;">Students engaged in a 4-day Debate Skills Training Workshop run by The Julia Gabriel Centre. This intensive and lively workshop trained students in critical thinking, argumentation and speaking skills – an excellent complement to the skills that students are learning in subjects such as Fundamental Humanities and Language Arts. Students had many opportunities to showcase their persuasive speaking skills through participating in hands-on debates.</p></td>

    <td><b>IP Year 3</b></td>
    <td><p style="text-align: justify;">Students participated in a Critical Thinking and Philosophy Programme specially designed by teachers from TJC’s A-Level Knowledge &amp; Inquiry team.

    <td><b>IP Year 4</b></td>
    <td><p style="text-align: justify;">Guided by the philosophy of “learning languages for life”, students developed their passion for their Mother Tongue languages and cultures through a range of exciting activities, such as a drama workshop by the Young People’s Performing Arts Ensemble.
