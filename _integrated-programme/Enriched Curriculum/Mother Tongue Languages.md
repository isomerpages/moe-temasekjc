# MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our department celebrates the diversity of languages and their intertwined rich cultures. We are committed to developing our students’ bilingualism and broadening their horizons in the study of these languages. By helping them grow in depth of thought and eloquence in oracy skills, we guide our students to be global citizens of the 21st Century world.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We offer a variety of Mother Tongue subjects at IP and JC levels respectively:</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify;">Recognizing the importance of learning languages for life, we aspire to strengthen our students’ bilingual competitive edge in this globalized world, to shape their cultural identity and to appreciate the cultures of other communities. We believe that with a heightened interest in Mother Tongue languages, students will become proficient and active learners who have the capacity for advanced language learning at the JC level.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">In recent years, our IP4 cohorts have achieved excellent results in the O-Level Mother Tongue Language and Higher Mother Tongue Language examination, with more than 1 in 2 students achieving Distinction in both 2019 and 2018, and 3 in 5 students obtaining Distinction in 2020. The excellent results have further earned our students bonuses to their University Admission Score, which gave them greater choices in university course selection as well as scholarship applications.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CURRICULUM</b><br>While guiding students towards academic excellence, we also seek to provide rich learning experiences to sustain their interest in the language. Through student-oriented teaching pedagogies and the harnessing of ICT, we cultivate their application skills, allowing them to use their power of imagination and critical thinking to analyse and solve problems.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">We also place emphasis on the nurturing of values and cultural appreciation. Through regular classroom discussions of social topics and scenario analysis, we aim to cultivate the value of empathy in our students as they navigate this complex modern world.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ENRICHMENT</b><br>We organise a series of exciting activities to enrich our students’ language learning experience. We do this through a tiered approach throughout the year, during Sabbatical Week, MTL Fortnight, Cohort Programme and during the post-examination period. Firstly, we organise learning journeys, drama appreciation and talks by local authors to expose all students to the application of the languages in daily authentic situations. Secondly, students get the opportunities to participate in seminars and workshops, where they are guided by experts in the areas of speaking and writing. Their learning experience is further enhanced through external activities and competitions. Finally, outstanding students who show a proficiency in languages are invited to join our talent development programme, where they specialise in particular skills and content of the languages.</p>
