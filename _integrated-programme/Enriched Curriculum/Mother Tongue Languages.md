# MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES

Our department celebrates the diversity of languages and their intertwined rich cultures. We are committed to developing our studentsâ€™ bilingualism and broadening their horizons in the study of these languages. By helping them grow in depth of thought and eloquence in oracy skills, we guide our students to be global citizens of the 21st Century world.
