# MATHEMATICS

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Mathematics department aims to equip our IP students with essential mathematical knowledge and skills to prepare them not only for the eventual A-Level curriculum, but also with a strong foundation in reasoning which is an essential life skill. Our syllabus is carefully designed and crafted, where we strategically select relevant topics and problems to develop strong problem-solving skills in our students.</p>


**CURRICULUM**

Our departmentâ€™s vision is to:

*   provide students with mathematical knowledge and skills;
*   <p style="text-align: justify;">develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving; and</p>
*   <p style="text-align: justify;">enable students to see connections in ideas between mathematics and other subjects through application and creating rules for naturally occurring patterns.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In their first 2 years, our IP students will study Fundamental Mathematics, which aims to develop mathematical competency in algebraic and symbolic manipulation. As they progress to IP Years 3 and 4, students will have many opportunities and platforms to explore mathematical topics in greater depth as they offer Intermediate and Advanced Mathematics.</p>
