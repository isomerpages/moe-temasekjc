# MATHEMATICS

Our Mathematics department aims to equip our IP students with essential mathematical knowledge and skills to prepare them not only for the eventual A-Level curriculum, but also with a strong foundation in reasoning which is an essential life skill. Our syllabus is carefully designed and crafted, where we strategically select relevant topics and problems to develop strong problem-solving skills in our students.
