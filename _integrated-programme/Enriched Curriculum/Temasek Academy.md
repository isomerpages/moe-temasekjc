			<p style="text-align: justify;">Temasek Academy (Language Arts) is an enrichment programme that develops academically talented IP1 and IP2 students in English language and literary skills. We aim to nurture students’ ability to write and speak with eloquence and conviction, and to engage critically and creatively with a wide variety of literary texts.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Through a series of workshops and seminars, students will hone their skills in literary analysis, creative writing, speaking, drama and journalism. Students will also have the opportunity to be mentored by established writers, journalists and relevant industry practitioners through the Creative Arts Programme and the Literature Seminar. In addition, students will participate in a variety of external competitions and programmes to build up their personal portfolios and have opportunities to interact and network with other likeminded students in other schools. For example, the Creative Writing Seminar held annually is an event jointly organized by Temasek Junior College, Dunman High School, Victoria School, Cedar Girls School and St Nicholas Girls’ School to build a strong community of avid readers and writers.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Temasek Academy (Mathematics) is an enrichment programme that aims to develop critical and
analytical thinkers who can leverage on their abilities to devise out-of-the-box approaches to
tackle unique problems. Under the tutelage of their tutors, TA (Mathematics) students will learn
the basics of Python programming through engaging platforms such as Minecraft. With Artificial
Intelligence (AI) gaining more traction in the near future, TA (Mathematics) students will have
the opportunity to dive deeper into the mathematics behind how Large Language Models (LLMs)
function through specially curated modules to gain a better understanding of how Generative AI
functions and its limitations. Furthermore, they will also be able to pit their wits against other
like-minded peers in various competitions such as the Singapore Mathematics Project Festival,
American Mathematics Competition, Australian Mathematics Competition and Singapore
Mathematical Olympiad.</p>

				<p style="text-align: justify;">Students offer core and elective modules that equip them with the necessary skills and sharpen their competencies in research areas in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). We have designed these tiered modules based on Renzulli’s Enrichment Triad model and here are some selected highlights:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Type I enrichment activities such as workshops and learning journeys organised by Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA);</p></li>
					<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Type II activities such as Science Olympiads, Young Defence Scientists Programme (YDSP), Science and Technology Camps; and</p></li>
				<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Type III activities such as Youth Science Ambassador Programme by Science Centre Singapore, Science Mentorship Programme by MOE Gifted Education Branch and Nanyang Research Programme (Junior) by NTU, where students expand their horizons and benefit under the mentorship of an external researcher.</p></li>
