    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Temasek Academy (Language Arts) is an enrichment programme that develops academically talented IP1 and IP2 students in English language and literary skills. We aim to nurture students’ ability to write and speak with eloquence and conviction, and to engage critically and creatively with a wide variety of literary texts.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Through a series of workshops and seminars, students will hone their skills in literary analysis, creative writing, speaking, drama and journalism. Students will also have the opportunity to be mentored by established writers, journalists and relevant industry practitioners through the Creative Arts Programme and the Literature Seminar. In addition, students will participate in a variety of external competitions and programmes to build up their personal portfolios and have opportunities to interact and network with other likeminded students in other schools. For example, the Creative Writing Seminar held annually is an event jointly organized by Temasek Junior College, Dunman High School, Victoria School, Cedar Girls School and St Nicholas Girls’ School to build a strong community of avid readers and writers.</p>

    <label for="accordion2">HUMANITIES</label>
    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Students in our Temasek Academy (Language Arts) programme seamlessly transition into Temasek Academy (Humanities) in Year 3, embarking on an exciting journey that nurtures students who think clearly, feel deeply and speak confidently. TA (Humanities) is designed for passionate and talented individuals eager to explore the complexities of human society through rigorous inquiry and meaningful discourse.</p>
			<p>In this dynamic programme, students engage in enriching experiences that challenge and inspire them:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Broadening Horizons</b>: Gain exposure to Humanities disciplines beyond the core curriculum, such as Economics and Philosophy, to develop a well-rounded understanding of the world;</p></li>
				<li><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Deep Diving into Discovery</b>: Pursue in-depth research on Humanities topics of choice through prestigious programmes like the Humanities and Social Science Research Programme (HSSRP), the Moot Parliament Programme, or internal Capstone papers; and</p></li>
	<li><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Learning Beyond the Classroom</b>: Apply classroom knowledge in the real world through hands-on fieldwork and immersive learning journeys that bring Humanities to life.</p></li>

		<label for="accordion3">CHINESE LANGUAGE</label>
    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Temasek Academy (Chinese Language) is a talent development programme that develops talented IP students with aptitude and keen interest in the Chinese language, literature and culture. We aim to nurture students’ ability to write and speak with eloquence and conviction, and to engage critically and creatively with a wide variety of literary texts and learning experiences.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Through a series of workshops and seminars, students will hone their skills in creative writing, speaking, translation, literary analysis, drama and journalism. Students will also have the opportunity to go on learning journeys as well as engage with local and overseas writers, journalists and relevant industry practitioners. In addition, students will participate in a variety of external competitions and programmes to build up their personal portfolios and have opportunities to interact and network with other likeminded students in other schools. For example, National Bilingual Creative Writing Competition, National Chinese Challenge, National Text Recital Competition and Young Reporter News Challenge.</p>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">All TA (Chinese Language) students will have the opportunity to join the MOE Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) from Year 3, where they learn literary analysis in depth, attain a higher level of proficiency and a better understanding of Chinese Language &amp; Literature. Outstanding students who offer JC subject H2 CLL may then enroll in CLEP at the JC level.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Temasek Academy (Mathematics) is an enrichment programme that aims to develop critical and analytical thinkers who can leverage on their abilities to devise out-of-the-box approaches to tackle unique problems. Under the tutelage of their tutors, TA (Mathematics) students will learn the basics of Python programming through engaging platforms such as Coursemology. With the increased emphasis on STEM, TA (Mathematics) students will have the opportunity to leverage on the College’s Makerspace to learn more about the programming behind 3D printing and create their own unique prototypes. In addition, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) gaining more traction, TA (Mathematics) students will dive deeper into the mathematics behind how Large Language Models (LLMs) function through specially curated modules to gain a better understanding of how Generative AI functions and its limitations. Furthermore, they will also be able to pit their wits against other like-minded peers in various competitions such as the Singapore Mathematics Project Festival, American Mathematics Competition, Australian Mathematics Competition and Singapore Mathematical Olympiad.</p>

    <label for="accordion5">SCIENCE</label>
    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Temasek Academy (Science) develops science-inclined and intellectually curious students to investigate, reflect and problem-solve through a systematic progression from IP1 to IP4. The structured experiences, designed based on Renzulli’s Enrichment Triad Model, equips them with the necessary skills and sharpen their competencies in research areas in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The core activities for each cohort gradually step up our students’ development of a scientific mindset and disposition:</p>
<ul>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">In IP1, students explore a soap-making process, in which they experiment with their own selected variations of factors and parameters, going beyond the typical prescribed experiments in the curriculum.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">In IP2, students experience the joy of making, and work with physical prototypes. Our students learn about flight by working with wood-based aircraft, and acquire 3D-modelling skills, experimenting with the College’s 3D printers and laser cutter.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">In IP3, students make use of all the skills they picked up in IP1 and IP2 in the Microbial Fuel Cell programme, in which they experiment with self-selected parameters, design and 3D-print their own fuel cells for an exploration that integrates concepts across the three sciences of Biology, Chemistry and Physics.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">In IP4, the experience culminates in a Sustainability Investigative Research (SIR) project after some preparatory groundwork at the end of IP3. Students propose a research project based on their own interest areas, with guidance by our Science teachers and STEM Instructor mentors, and carry out research over the first two terms. Some projects may then be fielded for relevant competitions thereafter.</p></li>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">Our TA (Science) students also typically participate in the following types of activities, some of which may be open to other students, as categorized by the Renzulli’s Enrichment Triad Model:</p>
		
<ul>
				<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Type I enrichment activities such as workshops and learning journeys;</p></li>
					<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Type II activities such as Junior Olympiads and other competitions for the three sciences, Young Defence Scientists Programme (YDSP), Science and Technology Camps; and</p></li>
				<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Type III activities such as Youth Science Ambassador Programme by Science Centre Singapore, Science Mentorship Programme by MOE Gifted Education Branch and Nanyang Research Programme (Junior) by NTU, where students expand their horizons and benefit under the mentorship of an external researcher.</p></li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a finale to their TA (Science) journey, our IP4 students contribute back to the College community by partnering the teachers to co-organise the annual e-THINK© Challenge, a science competition for Primary School students.  This event is supported by the following sponsors:</p>
