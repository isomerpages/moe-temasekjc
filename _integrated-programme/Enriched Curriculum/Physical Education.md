# PHYSICAL EDUCATION

Through Physical Education, we aim to develop physically proficient individuals who have the knowledge, skills and confidence to enjoy a lifelong appreciation of and participation in physical activity. Students learn to take ownership of their health as well as build social, psychomotor and cognitive skills through a variety of sports, fitness as well as conditioning challenges and outdoor education.

**CURRICULUM**

  

In addition to the robust PE curriculum where our students learn physical fitness and basic skills in a variety of sports & games, we have customized a unique Outdoor Education component which progressively trains our IP students in confidence-building and skills acquisition. In Years 1 and 2, they experience some of our Low Elements as well as Orienteering, Outdoor Cooking and Campcraft. In Years 3 and 4, they will move on to more complex and challenging activities such as Rock-climbing and Abseiling. These activities have been designed to equip our students with the essential knowledge and hands-on experience prior to attending the MOE-Outward Bound School course.
