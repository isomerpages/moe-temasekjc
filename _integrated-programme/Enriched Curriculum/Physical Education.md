# PHYSICAL EDUCATION

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through Physical Education, we aim to develop physically proficient individuals who have the knowledge, skills and confidence to enjoy a lifelong appreciation of and participation in physical activity. Students learn to take ownership of their health as well as build social, psychomotor and cognitive skills through a variety of sports, fitness as well as conditioning challenges and outdoor education.</p>

**CURRICULUM**

<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the robust PE curriculum where our students learn physical fitness and basic skills in a variety of sports & games, we have customized a unique Outdoor Education component which progressively trains our IP students in confidence-building and skills acquisition. In Years 1 and 2, they experience some of our Low Elements as well as Orienteering, Outdoor Cooking and Campcraft. In Years 3 and 4, they will move on to more complex and challenging activities such as Rock-climbing and Abseiling. These activities have been designed to equip our students with the essential knowledge and hands-on experience prior to attending the MOE-Outward Bound School course.</p>

**ENRICHMENT**

<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the Sports Education Programme (SEP), we organise special sports modules such as safe cycling for IP students to broaden their learning and pick up useful lifeskills beyond the curriculum. Our students can also look forward to Inter-Class or Intra-Class Sports Tournaments where they pit their skills against their peers in friendly competitions and learn sportsmanship. In a normal year, students can also step up as leaders to organise, plan and manage games and activities during Games Day. Even so, despite the pandemic, our students continue to immerse in healthy living, as they take part in a Virtual Marathon and maintain their virtual workouts to keep themselves physically and mentally fit.</p>
