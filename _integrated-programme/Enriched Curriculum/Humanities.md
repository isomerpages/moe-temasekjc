# HUMANITIES

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our IP Humanities department takes an interdisciplinary and integrated approach to engage students and nurture their ability to take multiple perspectives. Using real-world tasks and case studies, students will hone vital skills and competencies, such as critical thinking and analytical skills, which are essential for success in a globalised world.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At IP Years 1 and 2, students are introduced to Fundamental Humanities, an integrated subject that employs the lenses of History, Geography and Social Studies to give them a broad understanding of societies around the world. As they move on to IP Years 3 and 4, under the umbrella of Core Humanities, they may choose to deepen their learning in History, Geography or English Literature, in addition to Singapore Studies. Programmes are strongly centred on an inquiry-based approach using authentic learning experiences.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CURRICULUM</b><br>In designing our customised Fundamental Humanities curriculum, tutors start with the big picture in mind with lessons structured to enable students to work towards an enduring understanding for each topic. In IP Year 1, students explore the factors for the rise and fall of societies, and examine political systems such as democracy; while in IP Year 2, they examine the various ways that societies can change over time. Students also work towards the mastery of skills common to Humanities disciplines, such as inference, cross-referencing, data literacy and the use of well-defined criteria for comparison and evaluation.
</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ENRICHMENT</b><br>In addition to writing a comprehensive and engaging core curriculum, we have crafted additional teaching tools and experiences to further challenge students. For example, our award-winning Cities of Pangaea computer simulation gives our IP1 students the experience of building and maintaining a society. Through this, they can see how various geographical, economic and social factors work together to determine the outcomes of their society, and how these scenarios have played out in real-world societies over the course of history.
</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">We have also designed the V3 card game to give IP2 students a hands-on take on the factors that drive colonialism. This allows students to take on the role of a colonial power, and experience for themselves how certain factors may play a greater significance than previously assumed.
</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main features is the IP2 Fundamental Humanities Trip, which is designed for students to apply and extend what they have learnt in the classroom through authentic learning tasks framed as investigative mysteries that they have to solve throughout the journey from Ipoh to Penang. From peeking into the lives of tin miners to learning about the use of architecture as a tool for projection of power, the activities give the students greater insights into colonial legacies as well as the rationale and controversies behind the bicentennial commemoration back home.</p>
