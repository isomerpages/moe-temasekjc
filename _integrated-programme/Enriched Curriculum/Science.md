# SCIENCE

Aligned to TJC’s ACE outcomes, the IP Science Curriculum aims to nurture our students to become:

*   Critical & Inventive Thinkers;
*   Self-directed & Reflective Learners;
*   Caring & Collaborative Contributors; and
*   Effective & Ethical Communicators.


We develop our curriculum based on two main guiding principles:

*   A top-quality baseline learning for all students; and
*   A recognition that students’ learning is by design, not by chance.


**OUR SIGNATURE PEDAGOGY**

<p style="text-align: justify;">In nurturing students’ intellectual traits and passion in learning of Science for Life and Community, our signature curriculum has been designed based on our in-house THINK© Cycle and the Critical Thinking Framework (by Paul and Elder): (a) Scope of Thinking: 8 Elements of Thought (Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning) and (b) Quality of Thinking: 9 Intellectual Standards.</p>

<center>The THINK© Cycle</center>

<p style="text-align: justify;">THINK© Cycle pedagogy is a holistic approach that incorporates inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning and project-based learning. It comprises 5 elements: Trigger, Harness, Investigate, Network and Know. The pedagogical approach provides students with experiential learning that hones their 21st century competencies. Through Trigger, we excite and engage our students through highlighting daily observations that can be explained by Scientific concepts learnt. Besides picking up research skills at the Harness stage, students learn practical skills dealing with different laboratory apparatus and equipment including 3D printing and building prototypes when they Investigate in depth. In the process, students learn collaboration when they Network with their peers in their work groups and STEM projects where they integrate their learning in Science with Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Finally, our teachers will consolidate their learning so that they will Know and understand concepts at the authentic level.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students learn and apply critical thinking skills (Elements of Thought and Intellectual Standards) in a spiral manner from IP Year 1 to Year 4. These critical thinking skills are not only infused into the core curriculum that focuses on both the theory and practical aspects, they are further honed during IP Sabbatical Week and the post End-of-year Exam Science curriculum workshops.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">In Years 1 and 2, students take Green Science, a subject that integrates the three sciences – Biology, Chemistry and Physics with a focus on the Environment, Energy and Sustainability. From Year 3, students can choose to offer the triple science combination (Biology, Chemistry & Physics) or the double science combination (Physics & Chemistry; or Biology & Chemistry).</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>SCIENCE CURRICULUM RESEARCH PROJECTS</b><br>In the lower IP years, students are exposed to one Green Science Curriculum Research Project each year; and in upper IP, students are tasked to complete one Curriculum Research Project per science subject.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ADHOC COMMITTEE</b><br>This committee aims to support in the planning and implementation of College-initiated or PEERS-initiated activities that may be organised during the year. Such events may arise due to special occasions (e.g. commemorative events).</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>INTEREST GROUP</b><br>Parents in this committee are welcome to initiate activities for both parents or parent and child. These can include bonding activities, interest groups like gardening etc.</p>
