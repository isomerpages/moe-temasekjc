# SCIENCE

Aligned to TJC’s ACE outcomes, the IP Science Curriculum aims to nurture our students to become:

*   Critical & Inventive Thinkers;
*   Self-directed & Reflective Learners;
*   Caring & Collaborative Contributors; and
*   Effective & Ethical Communicators.


We develop our curriculum based on two main guiding principles:

*   A top-quality baseline learning for all students; and
*   A recognition that students’ learning is by design, not by chance.


**OUR SIGNATURE PEDAGOGY**

<p style="text-align: justify;">In nurturing students’ intellectual traits and passion in learning of Science for Life and Community, our signature curriculum has been designed based on our in-house THINK© Cycle and the Critical Thinking Framework (by Paul and Elder): (a) Scope of Thinking: 8 Elements of Thought (Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning) and (b) Quality of Thinking: 9 Intellectual Standards.</p>

<img src="/images/Academic/Enriched%20Curriculum/Science/THINK.png" style="width:60%">

<center>The THINK© Cycle</center>

<p style="text-align: justify;">THINK© Cycle pedagogy is a holistic approach that incorporates inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning and project-based learning. It comprises 5 elements: Trigger, Harness, Investigate, Network and Know. The pedagogical approach provides students with experiential learning that hones their 21st century competencies. Through Trigger, we excite and engage our students through highlighting daily observations that can be explained by Scientific concepts learnt. Besides picking up research skills at the Harness stage, students learn practical skills dealing with different laboratory apparatus and equipment including 3D printing and building prototypes when they Investigate in depth. In the process, students learn collaboration when they Network with their peers in their work groups and STEM projects where they integrate their learning in Science with Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Finally, our teachers will consolidate their learning so that they will Know and understand concepts at the authentic level.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students learn and apply critical thinking skills (Elements of Thought and Intellectual Standards) in a spiral manner from IP Year 1 to Year 4. These critical thinking skills are not only infused into the core curriculum that focuses on both the theory and practical aspects, they are further honed during IP Sabbatical Week and the post End-of-year Exam Science curriculum workshops.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">In Years 1 and 2, students take Green Science, a subject that integrates the three sciences – Biology, Chemistry and Physics with a focus on the Environment, Energy and Sustainability. From Year 3, students can choose to offer the triple science combination (Biology, Chemistry & Physics) or the double science combination (Physics & Chemistry; or Biology & Chemistry).</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>SCIENCE CURRICULUM RESEARCH PROJECTS</b><br>In the lower IP years, students are exposed to one Green Science Curriculum Research Project each year; and in upper IP, students are tasked to complete one Curriculum Research Project per science subject.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">All Science Curriculum Research Projects involve integrated Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) activities with various learning deliverables such as maintaining a logbook, PowerPoint presentation, poster presentation, infographics, video-making, prototype building and 3D printing. These projects provide students the opportunity to experience productive failure, which builds courage and a growth mindset in our students, as they ‘dare to explore, dare to challenge, dare to insist, dare to keep pushing, and dare to have the determination’ to succeed. Students are also given time and space for reflective learning. Through these experiences, students will realise that the joy of learning may entail occasional failures, but that the satisfaction in overcoming difficulties is even more enriching and meaningful! This will definitely instil in our students a lifelong interest in Science.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The IP Science Through Enrichment Programme (STEP) comprises three tiers where Tier 1 involves the entire cohort, Tier 2 focuses on selected students with aptitude and interest and finally Tier 3 which caters to our science talents through <a href="/academic/integrated-programme/enriched-curriculum/temasek-academy" target="_blank">Temasek Academy (Science)</a>.</p>
			<img src="/images/Academic/Enriched%20Curriculum/Science/STEP.png" style="width:80%">
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on Renzulli’s Enrichment Triad Model, all students are exposed to myriad opportunities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Type I Enrichment experiences involve discovering, stimulating and inspiring interest;</p></li>
   <li><p style="text-align: justify;">Type II Enrichment experiences come in two varieties – thinking skills, and ‘working’ skills, which are critical when embarking on Independent Investigation under Type III; and</p></li>
   <li><p style="text-align: justify;">Type III Enrichment experiences are academic investigations and projects focusing on a topic or problem of personal interest, while pursuing ‘self-selected’ areas (within guideline topics) for advanced content acquisition and process training in which students assume the role of first-hand inquirers.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">IP Year 1 to Year 4 students can participate in many enrichment programmes ranging from internally designed programmes to external programmes offered at national and international levels. Students are closely mentored by our teachers as they prepare for these competitions.</p>
