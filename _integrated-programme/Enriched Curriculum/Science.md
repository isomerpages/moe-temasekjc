# SCIENCE

Aligned to TJC’s ACE outcomes, the IP Science Curriculum aims to nurture our students to become:

*   Critical & Inventive Thinkers;
*   Self-directed & Reflective Learners;
*   Caring & Collaborative Contributors; and
*   Effective & Ethical Communicators.


We develop our curriculum based on two main guiding principles:

*   A top-quality baseline learning for all students; and
*   A recognition that students’ learning is by design, not by chance.


**OUR SIGNATURE PEDAGOGY**

<p style="text-align: justify;">In nurturing students’ intellectual traits and passion in learning of Science for Life and Community, our signature curriculum has been designed based on our in-house THINK© Cycle and the Critical Thinking Framework (by Paul and Elder): (a) Scope of Thinking: 8 Elements of Thought (Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning) and (b) Quality of Thinking: 9 Intellectual Standards.</p>
