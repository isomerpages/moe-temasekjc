# LANGUAGE ARTS

Our vision as a Language Arts department is to guide and empower our students to:

*   Use language confidently, accurately and effectively
*   Read widely across a range of genres and text types
*   Communicate their ideas with clarity and conviction
*   Form and articulate well-informed opinions about social and global issues, and
*   Approach issues with sensitivity and nuance, and appreciate multiple perspectives.

**CURRICULUM**

Language Arts focuses on a detailed analysis of literary and non-literary texts as well as essential comprehension and essay-writing skills. Students also work on projects that emphasise inter-disciplinary learning as students adapt literary texts, work on independent research, and hone their language skills through a range of creative contexts.
