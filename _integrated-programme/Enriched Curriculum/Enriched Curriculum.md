# ENRICHED CURRICULUM

<p style="text-align: justify;">We believe that every TJC IP student has talents to be developed and nurtured. To this end, we offer every IP student an enriched curriculum with talent development opportunities for all. <b>Integrated subjects</b> such as Language Arts, Fundamental Humanities and Green Science develop interdisciplinary thinkers who are adept at synthesizing ideas, concepts and knowledge. <b>Unique and specially-designed subjects</b> such as Skills & Knowledge develop our students into analytical and innovative problem-solvers, while Aesthetics nurtures an appreciation for the arts as well as the valuable skills of communication, empathy and creativity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The TJC IP curriculum gives students the space to find their passions and the guidance to hone their talents. It develops all students into forward-thinking, innovative and confident leaders who are curious about the world and passionate about their community.</p>
