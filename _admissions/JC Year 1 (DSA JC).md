<p>ABOUT DSA-JC</p>
<p>The Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides students with the opportunity
to seek admission to a Junior College (JC), based on a diverse range of
specific academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can
demonstrate beyond the GCE O-Level examination. S4E / S5NA O-Level students
seeking admission to a JC can consider applying through DSA-JC based on
your achievements and talents. You can also apply through the Joint Admissions
Exercise (JAE) after the release of your GCE O-level results if you cannot
decide at this juncture.
<br>
<br><strong>For more information on DSA-JC, please refer to the MOE website at <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/dsa" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-jc</a></strong>

<p>DSA-JC ENGAGEMENT SESSION</p>
<p><em>“I chose to join TJC through DSA (Leadership) because of its strong academic reputation and the vibrant school culture I experienced during past visits. I wanted to be part of a nurturing community where I could contribute to something larger than myself, and grow alongside like-minded peers. <br>Transitioning to TJC has been an exciting journey! The community here is welcoming, providing a conducive environment for both my leadership and academic growth. The experiences I have had so far have empowered me to explore my potential and hopefully make meaningful contributions within the school community and beyond.”</em> -
Felysha A’in Mohamed Shahril, President of TJC’s 48th Students’ Council,
alumna of St Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School</p>
