# JC YEAR 1 (DSA-JC)


<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are sitting for the GCE O-Level examinations at the end of this year and possess talents in the humanities, music, performing arts, sports, or have strong leadership qualities - TJC is the place for you to consider for your Junior College years! In TJC, we help every TJCian develop holistically and fulfil their potential through our robust curriculum and student development programmes.</p>

    <div>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a Junior College (JC), based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the GCE O-Level examination. Eligible students seeking admission to a JC can consider applying through DSA-JC based on your achievements and talents. You can also apply through the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) after the release of your GCE O-level results if you cannot decide at this juncture.</p>

The new building will facilitate collaborative and interactive learning and support the educational needs of our students in the future. TJC will move temporarily to the former Tampines JC site (2 Tampines Avenue 9, Singapore 529564) in January 2024 and we will be there until December 2027 while our current campus in Bedok is being rebuilt. Staff and students can look forward to moving back to our rebuilt campus in January 2028. The school will ensure that the transition between campuses will be as seamless as possible as we continue providing a top-quality learning experience for all our students.</i></b></p>
