			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a Junior College (JC), based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the GCE O-Level examination. Eligible students seeking admission to a JC can consider applying through DSA-JC based on your achievements and talents. You can also apply through the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) after the release of your GCE O-level results if you cannot decide at this juncture.</p>
