<h4><strong>About DSA-JC</strong></h4>
<p>The Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides students with the opportunity
to seek admission to a Junior College (JC), based on a diverse range of
specific academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can
demonstrate beyond the GCE O-Level Examination. S4E / S5NA O-Level students
seeking admission to a JC can consider applying through DSA-JC based on
your achievements and talents. You can also apply through the Joint Admissions
Exercise (JAE) after the release of your GCE O-level results if you cannot
decide at this juncture.</p>
<p><strong>For more information on DSA-JC, please refer to the MOE website at</strong>
