<h1>Appeal Application For IP Year 1 Registration (2025 Intake)</h1>
<p>MOE is committed to supporting holistic education and providing our students
with multiple pathways and opportunities to pursue an education best suited
to their needs and strengths, while remaining consistent with our key principles
of meritocracy, fairness, and transparency.</p>
<p>The PSLE remains as the objective and transparent measure of academic
merit for Secondary 1 (S1) posting. Therefore, school transfers after S1
Posting should be guided by the student’s PSLE scores and the receiving
school’s cutoff point (COP). This ensures that the S1 posting system remains
fair, transparent and objective.</p>
<p>Appeals that take place after the S1 Posting Exercise must be aligned
to the above principles. Students appealing for admission to TJC <strong>must meet TJC’s actual COP in this year’s S1 Posting.</strong>
</p>
<p>The cut-off points (COP) for TJC this year are as follows:</p>
