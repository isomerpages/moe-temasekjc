#### **A Heartiest Welcome to the Temasek Junior College Family!** ####

<p style="text-align: justify;">We understand that this transition stage from primary to secondary school will be a new experience for your child.<br>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We look forward in anticipation to the upcoming years, characterized by opportunities for growth, exploration, and accomplishments, that we will experience together.<br>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As your child takes his/her first step into Temasek JC, we want to ensure a smooth transition; and a crucial aspect of this is the completion of the IP1 E-Registration Exercise.<br>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that you <b>do not need</b> to report to TJC in person on S1 Posting &amp; Registration Day. <br></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, please complete the Online Registration Exercise by:

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2)	Completing and submitting the online IP1 Registration Form by 5.00 p.m. on 22 Dec 2023 (Friday). All students, including those posted to TJC via DSA-Sec, must submit this form. You will be considered to have completed the IP1 Registration Exercise only when you have submitted this form.
